if i know not the meaning of the voice  i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian  and he that speaketh  shall be  a barbarian unto me  
12	even so ye  forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual  gifts   seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church  
13	wherefore let him that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue pray that he may interpret  
14	for if i pray in an  unknown  tongue  my spirit prayeth  but my understanding is unfruitful  
15 	what is it then  i will pray with the spirit  and i will pray with the understanding also  i will sing with the spirit  and i will sing with the understanding also  
16	else when thou shalt bless with the spirit  how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks  seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest  
17	for thou verily givest thanks well  but the other is not edified  
18	i thank my god  i speak with tongues more than ye all  
19	yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding  that  by my voice  i might teach others also  than ten thousand words in an  unknown  tongue  
20	brethren  be not children in understanding  howbeit in malice be ye children  but in understanding be men  
21 	in the law it is written  with  men of  other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people  and yet for all that will they not hear me  saith the lord  
22	wherefore tongues are for a sign  not to them that believe  but to them that believe not  but prophesying  serveth  not for them that believe not  but for them which believe  
23	if therefore the whole church be come together into one place  and all speak with tongues  and there come in  those that are  unlearned  or unbelievers  will they not say that ye are mad  
24	but if all prophesy  and there come in one that believeth not  or  one  unlearned  he is convinced of all  he is judged of all  
25	and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest  and so falling down on  his  face he will worship god  and report that god is in you of a truth  
26 	how is it then  brethren  when ye come together  every one of you hath a psalm  hath a doctrine  hath a tongue  hath a revelation  hath an interpretation  let all things be done unto edifying  
27	if any man speak in an  unknown  tongue   let it be  by two  or at the most  by  three  and  that  by course  and let one interpret  
28	but if there be no interpreter  let him keep silence in the church  and let him speak to himself  and to god  
29	let the prophets speak two or three  and let the other judge  
30	if  any thing  be revealed to another that sitteth by  let the first hold his peace  
31	for ye may all prophesy one by one  that all may learn  and all may be comforted  
32	and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets  
33	for god is not  the author  of confusion  but of peace  as in all churches of the saints  
34 	let your women keep silence in the churches  for it is not permitted unto them to speak  but  they are commanded  to be under obedience  as also saith the law  
35	and if they will learn any thing  let them ask their husbands at home  for it is a shame for women to speak in the church  
36 	what  came the word of god out from you  or came it unto you only  
37	if any man think himself to be a prophet  or spiritual  let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord  
38	but if any man be ignorant  let him be ignorant  
39	wherefore  brethren  covet to prophesy  and forbid not to speak with tongues  
40	let all things be done decently and in order  
1 corinthians 15
1 	moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand  
2	by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain  
3	for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures  
4	and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures  
5	and that he was seen of cephas  then of the twelve  
6	after that  he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once  of whom the greater part remain unto this present  but some are fallen asleep  
7	after that  he was seen of james  then of all the apostles  
8	and last of all he was seen of me also  as of one born out of due time  
9	for i am the least of the apostles  that am not meet to be called an apostle  because i persecuted the church of god  
10	but by the grace of god i am what i am  and his grace which  was bestowed  upon me was not in vain  but i laboured more abundantly than they all  yet not i  but the grace of god which was with me  
11	therefore whether  it were  i or they  so we preach  and so ye believed  
12 	now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead  how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead  
13	but if there be no resurrection of the dead  then is christ not risen  
14	and if christ be not risen  then  is  our preaching vain  and your faith  is  also vain  
15	yea  and we are found false witnesses of god  because we have testified of god that he raised up christ  whom he raised not up  if so be that the dead rise not  
16	for if the dead rise not  then is not christ raised  
17	and if christ be not raised  your faith  is  vain  ye are yet in your sins  
18	then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished  
19	if in this life only we have hope in christ  we are of all men most miserable  
20 	but now is christ risen from the dead   and  become the firstfruits of them that slept  
21	for since by man  came  death  by man  came  also the resurrection of the dead  
22	for as in adam all die  even so in christ shall all be made alive  
23	but every man in his own order  christ the firstfruits  afterward they that are christ s at his coming  
24	then  cometh  the end  when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god  even the father  when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power  
25	for he must reign  till he hath put all enemies under his feet  
26	the last enemy  that  shall be destroyed  is  death  
27	for he hath put all things under his feet  but when he saith all things are put under  him  it is  manifest that he is excepted  which did put all things under him  
28	and when all things shall be subdued unto him  then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him  that god may be all in all  
29	else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead  if the dead rise not at all  why are they then baptized for the dead  
30	and why stand we in jeopardy every hour  
31	i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord  i die daily  
32	if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus  what advantageth it me  if the dead rise not  let us eat and drink  for to morrow we die  
33	be not deceived  evil communications corrupt good manners  
34	awake to righteousness  and sin not  for some have not the knowledge of god  i speak  this  to your shame  
35 	but some  man  will say  how are the dead raised up  and with what body do they come  
36	 thou  fool  that which thou sowest is not quickened  except it die  
37	and that which thou sowest  thou sowest not that body that shall be  but bare grain  it may chance of wheat  or of some other  grain   
38	but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him  and to every seed his own body  
39	all flesh  is  not the same flesh  but  there is  one  kind of  flesh of men  another flesh of beasts  another of fishes   and  another of birds  
40	 there are  also celestial bodies  and bodies terrestrial  but the glory of the celestial  is  one  and the  glory  of the terrestrial  is  another  
41	 there is  one glory of the sun  and another glory of the moon  and another glory of the stars  for  one  star differeth from  another  star in glory  
42	so also  is  the resurrection of the dead  it is sown in corruption  it is raised in incorruption  
43	it is sown in dishonour  it is raised in glory  it is sown in weakness  it is raised in power  
44	it is sown a natural body  it is raised a spiritual body  there is a natural body  and there is a spiritual body  
45	and so it is written  the first man adam was made a living soul  the last adam  was made  a quickening spirit  
46	howbeit that  was  not first which is spiritual  but that which is natural  and afterward that which is spiritual  
47	the first man  is  of the earth  earthy  the second man  is  the lord from heaven  
48	as  is  the earthy  such  are  they also that are earthy  and as  is  the heavenly  such  are  they also that are heavenly  
49	and as we have borne the image of the earthy  we shall also bear the image of the heavenly  
50	now this i say  brethren  that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god  neither doth corruption inherit incorruption  
51 	behold  i shew you a mystery  we shall not all sleep  but we shall all be changed  
52	in a moment  in the twinkling of an eye  at the last trump  for the trumpet shall sound  and the dead shall be raised incorruptible  and we shall be changed  
53	for this corruptible must put on incorruption  and this mortal  must  put on immortality  
54	so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption  and this mortal shall have put on immortality  then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written  death is swallowed up in victory  
55	o death  where  is  thy sting  o grave  where  is  thy victory  
56	the sting of death  is  sin  and the strength of sin  is  the law  
57	but thanks  be  to god  which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ  
58 	therefore  my beloved brethren  be ye stedfast  unmoveable  always abounding in the work of the lord  forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord  
1 corinthians 16
1 	now concerning the collection for the saints  as i have given order to the churches of galatia  even so do ye  
2	upon the first  day  of the week let every one of you lay by him in store  as  god  hath prospered him  that there be no gatherings when i come  
3	and when i come  whomsoever ye shall approve by  your  letters  them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem  
4	and if it be meet that i go also  they shall go with me  
5 	now i will come unto you  when i shall pass through macedonia  for i do pass through macedonia  
6	and it may be that i will abide  yea  and winter with you  that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go  
7	for i will not see you now by the way  but i trust to tarry a while with you  if the lord permit  
8	but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost  
9	for a great door and effectual is opened unto me  and  there are  many adversaries  
10 	now if timotheus come  see that he may be with you without fear  for he worketh the work of the lord  as i also  do   
11	let no man therefore despise him  but conduct him forth in peace  that he may come unto me  for i look for him with the brethren  
12	as touching  our  brother apollos  i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren  but his will was not at all to come at this time  but he will come when he shall have convenient time  
13 	watch ye  stand fast in the faith  quit you like men  be strong  
14	let all your things be done with charity  
15	i beseech you  brethren   ye know the house of stephanas  that it is the firstfruits of achaia  and  that  they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints   
16	that ye submit yourselves unto such  and to every one that helpeth with  us   and laboureth  
17	i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus  for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied  
18	for they have refreshed my spirit and yours  therefore acknowledge ye them that are such  
19 	the churches of asia salute you  aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord  with the church that is in their house  
20	all the brethren greet you  greet ye one another with an holy kiss  
21	the salutation of  me  paul with mine own hand  
22	if any man love not the lord jesus christ  let him be anathema maranatha  
23	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you  
24	my love  be  with you all in christ jesus  amen    the first  epistle  to the corinthians was written from philippi by stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus and timotheus   

2 corinthians
2 corinthians 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god  and timothy  our  brother  unto the church of god which is at corinth  with all the saints which are in all achaia  
2	grace  be  to you and peace from god our father  and  from  the lord jesus christ  
3 	blessed  be  god  even the father of our lord jesus christ  the father of mercies  and the god of all comfort  
4	who comforteth us in all our tribulation  that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble  by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god  
5	for as the sufferings of christ abound in us  so our consolation also aboundeth by christ  
6	and whether we be afflicted   it is  for your consolation and salvation  which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer  or whether we be comforted   it is  for your consolation and salvation  
7 	and our hope of you  is  stedfast  knowing  that as ye are partakers of the sufferings  so  shall ye be  also of the consolation  
8	for we would not  brethren  have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia  that we were pressed out of measure  above strength  insomuch that we despaired even of life  
9	but we had the sentence of death in ourselves  that we should not trust in ourselves  but in god which raiseth the dead  
10	who delivered us from so great a death  and doth deliver  in whom we trust that he will yet deliver  us   
11	ye also helping together by prayer for us  that for the gift  bestowed  upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf  
12 	for our rejoicing is this  the testimony of our conscience  that in simplicity and godly sincerity  not with fleshly wisdom  but by the grace of god  we have had our conversation in the world  and more abundantly to you ward  
13	for we write none other things unto you  than what ye read or acknowledge  and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end  
14	as also ye have acknowledged us in part  that we are your rejoicing  even as ye also  are  ours in the day of the lord jesus  
15 	and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before  that ye might have a second benefit  
16	and to pass by you into macedonia  and to come again out of macedonia unto you  and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea  
17	when i therefore was thus minded  did i use lightness  or the things that i purpose  do i purpose according to the flesh  that with me there should be yea yea  and nay nay  
18	but  as  god  is  true  our word toward you was not yea and nay  
19	for the son of god  jesus christ  who was preached among you by us   even  by me and silvanus and timotheus  was not yea and nay  but in him was yea  
20	for all the promises of god in him  are  yea  and in him amen  unto the glory of god by us  
21	now he which stablisheth us with you in christ  and hath anointed us   is  god  
22	who hath also sealed us  and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts  
23	moreover i call god for a record upon my soul  that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth  
24	not for that we have dominion over your faith  but are helpers of your joy  for by faith ye stand  
2 corinthians 2
1 	but i determined this with myself  that i would not come again to you in heaviness  
2	for if i make you sorry  who is he then that maketh me glad  but the same which is made sorry by me  
3	and i wrote this same unto you  lest  when i came  i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice  having confidence in you all  that my joy is  the joy  of you all  
4	for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears  not that ye should be grieved  but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you  
5 	but if any have caused grief  he hath not grieved me  but in part  that i may not overcharge you all  
6	sufficient to such a man  is  this punishment  which  was inflicted  of many  
7	so that contrariwise ye  ought  rather to forgive  him   and comfort  him   lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow  
8	wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm  your  love toward him  
9	for to this end also did i write  that i might know the proof of you  whether ye be obedient in all things  
10	to whom ye forgive any thing  i  forgive  also  for if i forgave any thing  to whom i forgave  it   for your sakes  forgave i it  in the person of christ  
11	lest satan should get an advantage of us  for we are not ignorant of his devices  
12 	furthermore  when i came to troas to  preach  christ s gospel  and a door was opened unto me of the lord  
13	i had no rest in my spirit  because i found not titus my brother  but taking my leave of them  i went from thence into macedonia  
14	now thanks  be  unto god  which always causeth us to triumph in christ  and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place  
15	for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ  in them that are saved  and in them that perish  
16	to the one  we are  the savour of death unto death  and to the other the savour of life unto life  and who  is  sufficient for these things  
17	for we are not as many  which corrupt the word of god  but as of sincerity  but as of god  in the sight of god speak we in christ  
2 corinthians 3
1 	do we begin again to commend ourselves  or need we  as some  others   epistles of commendation to you  or  letters  of commendation from you  
2	ye are our epistle written in our hearts  known and read of all men  
3	 forasmuch as ye are  manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us  written not with ink  but with the spirit of the living god  not in tables of stone  but in fleshy tables of the heart  
4	and such trust have we through christ to god ward  
5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves  but our sufficiency  is  of god  
6 	who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament  not of the letter  but of the spirit  for the letter killeth  but the spirit giveth life  
7	but if the ministration of death  written  and  engraven in stones  was glorious  so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance  which  glory  was to be done away  
8	how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious  
9	for if the ministration of condemnation  be  glory  much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory  
10	for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect  by reason of the glory that excelleth  
11	for if that which is done away  was  glorious  much more that which remaineth  is  glorious  
12 	seeing then that we have such hope  we use great plainness of speech  
13	and not as moses   which  put a vail over his face  that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished  
14	but their minds were blinded  for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament  which  vail  is done away in christ  
15	but even unto this day  when moses is read  the vail is upon their heart  
16	nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord  the vail shall be taken away  
17	now the lord is that spirit  and where the spirit of the lord  is   there  is  liberty  
18	but we all  with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord  are changed into the same image from glory to glory   even  as by the spirit of the lord  
2 corinthians 4
1 	therefore seeing we have this ministry  as we have received mercy  we faint not  
2	but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty  not walking in craftiness  nor handling the word of god deceitfully  but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man s conscience in the sight of god  
3	but if our gospel be hid  it is hid to them that are lost  
4	in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not  lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ  who is the image of god  should shine unto them  
5	for we preach not ourselves  but christ jesus the lord  and ourselves your servants for jesus  sake  
6	for god  who commanded the light to shine out of darkness  hath shined in our hearts  to  give  the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ  
7	but we have this treasure in earthen vessels  that the excellency of the power may be of god  and not of us  
8 	 we are  troubled on every side  yet not distressed   we are  perplexed  but not in despair  
9	persecuted  but not forsaken  cast down  but not destroyed  
10	always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus  that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body  
11	for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus  sake  that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh  
12	so then death worketh in us  but life in you  
13	we having the same spirit of faith  according as it is written  i believed  and therefore have i spoken  we also believe  and therefore speak  
14	knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus  and shall present  us  with you  
15	for all things  are  for your sakes  that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god  
16	for which cause we faint not  but though our outward man perish  yet the inward  man  is renewed day by day  
17	for our light affliction  which is but for a moment  worketh for us a far more exceeding  and  eternal weight of glory  
18	while we look not at the things which are seen  but at the things which are not seen  for the things which are seen  are  temporal  but the things which are not seen  are  eternal  
2 corinthians 5
1 	for we know that if our earthly house of  this  tabernacle were dissolved  we have a building of god  an house not made with hands  eternal in the heavens  
2	for in this we groan  earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven  
3	if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked  
4	for we that are in  this  tabernacle do groan  being burdened  not for that we would be unclothed  but clothed upon  that mortality might be swallowed up of life  
5	now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing  is  god  who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit  
6	therefore  we are  always confident  knowing that  whilst we are at home in the body  we are absent from the lord  
7	 for we walk by faith  not by sight   
8	we are confident   i say   and willing rather to be absent from the body  and to be present with the lord  
9	wherefore we labour  that  whether present or absent  we may be accepted of him  
10	for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ  that every one may receive the things  done  in  his  body  according to that he hath done  whether  it be  good or bad  
11	knowing therefore the terror of the lord  we persuade men  but we are made manifest unto god  and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences  
12 	for we commend not ourselves again unto you  but give you occasion to glory on our behalf  that ye may have somewhat to  answer  them which glory in appearance  and not in heart  
13	for whether we be beside ourselves   it is  to god  or whether we be sober   it is  for your cause  
14	for the love of christ constraineth us  because we thus judge  that if one died for all  then were all dead  
15	and  that  he died for all  that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves  but unto him which died for them  and rose again  
16 	wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh  yea  though we have known christ after the flesh  yet now henceforth know we  him  no more  
17	therefore if any man  be  in christ   he is  a new creature  old things are passed away  behold  all things are become new  
18	and all things  are  of god  who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ  and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation  
19	to wit  that god was in christ  reconciling the world unto himself  not imputing their trespasses unto them  and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation  
20	now then we are ambassadors for christ  as though god did beseech  you  by us  we pray  you  in christ s stead  be ye reconciled to god  
21	for he hath made him  to be  sin for us  who knew no sin  that we might be made the righteousness of god in him  
2 corinthians 6
1 	we then   as  workers together  with him   beseech  you  also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain  
2	 for he saith  i have heard thee in a time accepted  and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee  behold  now  is  the accepted time  behold  now  is  the day of salvation   
3	giving no offence in any thing  that the ministry be not blamed  
4	but in all  things  approving ourselves as the ministers of god  in much patience  in afflictions  in necessities  in distresses  
5	in stripes  in imprisonments  in tumults  in labours  in watchings  in fastings  
6	by pureness  by knowledge  by longsuffering  by kindness  by the holy ghost  by love unfeigned  
7	by the word of truth  by the power of god  by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left  
8	by honour and dishonour  by evil report and good report  as deceivers  and  yet  true  
9	as unknown  and  yet  well known  as dying  and  behold  we live  as chastened  and not killed  
10	as sorrowful  yet alway rejoicing  as poor  yet making many rich  as having nothing  and  yet  possessing all things  
11 	o  ye  corinthians  our mouth is open unto you  our heart is enlarged  
12	ye are not straitened in us  but ye are straitened in your own bowels  
13	now for a recompence in the same   i speak as unto  my  children   be ye also enlarged  
14	be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers  for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness  and what communion hath light with darkness  
15	and what concord hath christ with belial  or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel  
16	and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols  for ye are the temple of the living god  as god hath said  i will dwell in them  and walk in  them   and i will be their god  and they shall be my people  
17	wherefore come out from among them  and be ye separate  saith the lord  and touch not the unclean  thing   and i will receive you  
18	and will be a father unto you  and ye shall be my sons and daughters  saith the lord almighty  
2 corinthians 7
1 	having therefore these promises  dearly beloved  let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit  perfecting holiness in the fear of god  
2	receive us  we have wronged no man  we have corrupted no man  we have defrauded no man  
3	i speak not  this  to condemn  you   for i have said before  that ye are in our hearts to die and live with  you   
4	great  is  my boldness of speech toward you  great  is  my glorying of you  i am filled with comfort  i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation  
5 	for  when we were come into macedonia  our flesh had no rest  but we were troubled on every side  without  were  fightings  within  were  fears  
6	nevertheless god  that comforteth those that are cast down  comforted us by the coming of titus  
7	and not by his coming only  but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you  when he told us your earnest desire  your mourning  your fervent mind toward me  so that i rejoiced the more  
8	for though i made you sorry with a letter  i do not repent  though i did repent  for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry  though  it were  but for a season  
9	now i rejoice  not that ye were made sorry  but that ye sorrowed to repentance  for ye were made sorry after a godly manner  that ye might receive damage by us in nothing  
10	for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of  but the sorrow of the world worketh death  
11	for behold this selfsame thing  that ye sorrowed after a godly sort  what carefulness it wrought in you  yea   what  clearing of yourselves  yea   what  indignation  yea   what  fear  yea   what  vehement desire  yea   what  zeal  yea   what  revenge  in all  things  ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter  
12 	wherefore  though i wrote unto you   i did it  not for his cause that had done the wrong  nor for his cause that suffered wrong  but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you  
13	therefore we were comforted in your comfort  yea  and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus  because his spirit was refreshed by you all  
14	for if i have boasted any thing to him of you  i am not ashamed  but as we spake all things to you in truth  even so our boasting  which  i made  before titus  is found a truth  
15	and his inward affection is more abundant toward you  whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all  how with fear and trembling ye received him  
16	i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all  things   
2 corinthians 8
1 	moreover  brethren  we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia  
2	how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality  
3	for to  their  power  i bear record  yea  and beyond  their  power  they were  willing of themselves  
4	praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift  and  take upon us  the fellowship of the ministering to the saints  
5	and  this they did   not as we hoped  but first gave their own selves to the lord  and unto us by the will of god  
6	insomuch that we desired titus  that as he had begun  so he would also finish in you the same grace also  
7 	therefore  as ye abound in every  thing  in  faith  and utterance  and knowledge  and  in  all diligence  and  in  your love to us   see  that ye abound in this grace also  
8	i speak not by commandment  but by occasion of the forwardness of others  and to prove the sincerity of your love  
9	for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ  that  though he was rich  yet for your sakes he became poor  that ye through his poverty might be rich  
10	and herein i give  my  advice  for this is expedient for you  who have begun before  not only to do  but also to be forward a year ago  
11	now therefore perform the doing  of it   that as  there was  a readiness to will  so  there may be  a performance also out of that which ye have  
12	for if there be first a willing mind   it is  accepted according to that a man hath   and  not according to that he hath not  
13	for  i mean  not that other men be eased  and ye burdened  
14	but by an equality   that  now at this time your abundance  may be a supply  for their want  that their abundance also may be  a supply  for your want  that there may be equality  
15	as it is written  he that  had gathered  much had nothing over  and he that  had gathered  little had no lack  
16 	but thanks  be  to god  which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you  
17	for indeed he accepted the exhortation  but being more forward  of his own accord he went unto you  
18	and we have sent with him the brother  whose praise  is  in the gospel throughout all the churches  
19	and not  that  only  but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace  which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord  and  declaration of  your ready mind  
20	avoiding this  that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  
21	providing for honest things  not only in the sight of the lord  but also in the sight of men  
22	and we have sent with them our brother  whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things  but now much more diligent  upon the great confidence which  i have  in you  
23	whether  any do enquire  of titus   he is  my partner and fellowhelper concerning you  or our brethren  be enquired of  they are  the messengers of the churches   and  the glory of christ  
24	wherefore shew ye to them  and before the churches  the proof of your love  and of our boasting on your behalf  
2 corinthians 9
1 	for as touching the ministering to the saints  it is superfluous for me to write to you  
2	for i know the forwardness of your mind  for which i boast of you to them of macedonia  that achaia was ready a year ago  and your zeal hath provoked very many  
3	yet have i sent the brethren  lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf  that  as i said  ye may be ready  
4	lest haply if they of macedonia come with me  and find you unprepared  we  that we say not  ye  should be ashamed in this same confident boasting  
5	therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren  that they would go before unto you  and make up beforehand your bounty  whereof ye had notice before  that the same might be ready  as  a matter of  bounty  and not as  of  covetousness  
6 	but this  i say   he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly  and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully  
7	every man according as he purposeth in his heart   so let him give   not grudgingly  or of necessity  for god loveth a cheerful giver  
8	and god  is  able to make all grace abound toward you  that ye  always having all sufficiency in all  things   may abound to every good work  
9	 as it is written  he hath dispersed abroad  he hath given to the poor  his righteousness remaineth for ever  
10	now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for  your  food  and multiply your seed sown  and increase the fruits of your righteousness   
11	being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness  which causeth through us thanksgiving to god  
12	for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints  but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god  
13	whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ  and for  your  liberal distribution unto them  and unto all  men   
14	and by their prayer for you  which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you  
15	thanks  be  unto god for his unspeakable gift  
2 corinthians 10
1 	now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ  who in presence  am  base among you  but being absent am bold toward you  
2	but i beseech  you   that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence  wherewith i think to be bold against some  which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh  
3	for though we walk in the flesh  we do not war after the flesh  
4	 for the weapons of our warfare  are  not carnal  but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds   
5	casting down imaginations  and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god  and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ  
6	and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience  when your obedience is fulfilled  
7 	do ye look on things after the outward appearance  if any man trust to himself that he is christ s  let him of himself think this again  that  as he  is  christ s  even so  are  we christ s  
8	for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority  which the lord hath given us for edification  and not for your destruction  i should not be ashamed  
9	that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters  
10	for  his  letters  say they   are  weighty and powerful  but  his  bodily presence  is  weak  and  his  speech contemptible  
11	let such an one think this  that  such as we are in word by letters when we are absent  such  will we be  also in deed when we are present  
12 	for we dare not make ourselves of the number  or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves  but they measuring themselves by themselves  and comparing themselves among themselves  are not wise  
13	but we will not boast of things without  our  measure  but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us  a measure to reach even unto you  
14	for we stretch not ourselves beyond  our measure   as though we reached not unto you  for we are come as far as to you also in  preaching  the gospel of christ  
15	not boasting of things without  our  measure   that is   of other men s labours  but having hope  when your faith is increased  that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly  
16	to preach the gospel in the  regions  beyond you   and  not to boast in another man s line of things made ready to our hand  
17	but he that glorieth  let him glory in the lord  
18	for not he that commendeth himself is approved  but whom the lord commendeth  
2 corinthians 11
1 	would to god ye could bear with me a little in  my  folly  and indeed bear with me  
2	for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy  for i have espoused you to one husband  that i may present  you as  a chaste virgin to christ  
3	but i fear  lest by any means  as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty  so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ  
4	for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus  whom we have not preached  or  if  ye receive another spirit  which ye have not received  or another gospel  which ye have not accepted  ye might well bear with  him   
5 	for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles  
6	but though  i be  rude in speech  yet not in knowledge  but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things  
7	have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted  because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely  
8	i robbed other churches  taking wages  of them   to do you service  
9	and when i was present with you  and wanted  i was chargeable to no man  for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied  and in all  things  i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you  and  so  will i keep  myself   
10	as the truth of christ is in me  no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia  
11	wherefore  because i love you not  god knoweth  
12	but what i do  that i will do  that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion  that wherein they glory  they may be found even as we  
13	for such  are  false apostles  deceitful workers  transforming themselves into the apostles of christ  
14	and no marvel  for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light  
15	therefore  it is  no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness  whose end shall be according to their works  
16 	i say again  let no man think me a fool  if otherwise  yet as a fool receive me  that i may boast myself a little  
17	that which i speak  i speak  it  not after the lord  but as it were foolishly  in this confidence of boasting  
18	seeing that many glory after the flesh  i will glory also  
19	for ye suffer fools gladly  seeing ye  yourselves  are wise  
20	for ye suffer  if a man bring you into bondage  if a man devour  you   if a man take  of you   if a man exalt himself  if a man smite you on the face  
21	i speak as concerning reproach  as though we had been weak  howbeit whereinsoever any is bold   i speak foolishly   i am bold also  
22 	are they hebrews  so  am  i  are they israelites  so  am  i  are they the seed of abraham  so  am  i  
23	are they ministers of christ   i speak as a fool  i  am  more  in labours more abundant  in stripes above measure  in prisons more frequent  in deaths oft  
24	of the jews five times received i forty  stripes  save one  
25	thrice was i beaten with rods  once was i stoned  thrice i suffered shipwreck  a night and a day i have been in the deep  
26	 in  journeyings often   in  perils of waters   in  perils of robbers   in  perils by  mine own  countrymen   in  perils by the heathen   in  perils in the city   in  perils in the wilderness   in  perils in the sea   in  perils among false brethren  
27	in weariness and painfulness  in watchings often  in hunger and thirst  in fastings often  in cold and nakedness  
28	beside those things that are without  that which cometh upon me daily  the care of all the churches  
29	who is weak  and i am not weak  who is offended  and i burn not  
30	if i must needs glory  i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities  
31	the god and father of our lord jesus christ  which is blessed for evermore  knoweth that i lie not  
32	in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison  desirous to apprehend me  
33	and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall  and escaped his hands  
2 corinthians 12
1 	it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory  i will come to visions and revelations of the lord  
2	i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago   whether in the body  i cannot tell  or whether out of the body  i cannot tell  god knoweth   such an one caught up to the third heaven  
3	and i knew such a man   whether in the body  or out of the body  i cannot tell  god knoweth   
4	how that he was caught up into paradise  and heard unspeakable words  which it is not lawful for a man to utter  
5	of such an one will i glory  yet of myself i will not glory  but in mine infirmities  
6	for though i would desire to glory  i shall not be a fool  for i will say the truth  but  now  i forbear  lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me  to be   or  that  he heareth of me  
7	and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations  there was given to me a thorn in the flesh  the messenger of satan to buffet me  lest i should be exalted above measure  
8	for this thing i besought the lord thrice  that it might depart from me  
9	and he said unto me  my grace is sufficient for thee  for my strength is made perfect in weakness  most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities  that the power of christ may rest upon me  
10	therefore i take pleasure in infirmities  in reproaches  in necessities  in persecutions  in distresses for christ s sake  for when i am weak  then am i strong  
11 	i am become a fool in glorying  ye have compelled me  for i ought to have been commended of you  for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles  though i be nothing  
12	truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience  in signs  and wonders  and mighty deeds  
13	for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches  except  it be  that i myself was not burdensome to you  forgive me this wrong  
14	behold  the third time i am ready to come to you  and i will not be burdensome to you  for i seek not yours  but you  for the children ought not to lay up for the parents  but the parents for the children  
15	and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you  though the more abundantly i love you  the less i be loved  
16	but be it so  i did not burden you  nevertheless  being crafty  i caught you with guile  
17	did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you  
18	i desired titus  and with  him  i sent a brother  did titus make a gain of you  walked we not in the same spirit   walked we  not in the same steps  
19	again  think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you  we speak before god in christ  but  we do  all things  dearly beloved  for your edifying  
20	for i fear  lest  when i come  i shall not find you such as i would  and  that  i shall be found unto you such as ye would not  lest  there be  debates  envyings  wraths  strifes  backbitings  whisperings  swellings  tumults  
21	 and  lest  when i come again  my god will humble me among you  and  that  i shall bewail many which have sinned already  and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed  
2 corinthians 13
1 	this  is  the third  time  i am coming to you  in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established  
2	i told you before  and foretell you  as if i were present  the second time  and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned  and to all other  that  if i come again  i will not spare  
3	since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me  which to you ward is not weak  but is mighty in you  
4	for though he was crucified through weakness  yet he liveth by the power of god  for we also are weak in him  but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you  
5	examine yourselves  whether ye be in the faith  prove your own selves  know ye not your own selves  how that jesus christ is in you  except ye be reprobates  
6	but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates  
7 	now i pray to god that ye do no evil  not that we should appear approved  but that ye should do that which is honest  though we be as reprobates  
8	for we can do nothing against the truth  but for the truth  
9	for we are glad  when we are weak  and ye are strong  and this also we wish   even  your perfection  
10	therefore i write these things being absent  lest being present i should use sharpness  according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification  and not to destruction  
11 	finally  brethren  farewell  be perfect  be of good comfort  be of one mind  live in peace  and the god of love and peace shall be with you  
12	greet one another with an holy kiss  
13	all the saints salute you  
14	the grace of the lord jesus christ  and the love of god  and the communion of the holy ghost   be  with you all  amen    the second  epistle  to the corinthians was written from philippi   a city  of macedonia  by titus and lucas   

galatians
galatians 1
1 	paul  an apostle   not of men  neither by man  but by jesus christ  and god the father  who raised him from the dead   
2	and all the brethren which are with me  unto the churches of galatia  
3	grace  be  to you and peace from god the father  and  from  our lord jesus christ  
4	who gave himself for our sins  that he might deliver us from this present evil world  according to the will of god and our father  
5	to whom  be  glory for ever and ever  amen  
6 	i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel  
7	which is not another  but there be some that trouble you  and would pervert the gospel of christ  
8	but though we  or an angel from heaven  preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you  let him be accursed  
9	as we said before  so say i now again  if any  man  preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received  let him be accursed  
10 	for do i now persuade men  or god  or do i seek to please men  for if i yet pleased men  i should not be the servant of christ  
11	but i certify you  brethren  that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man  
12	for i neither received it of man  neither was i taught  it   but by the revelation of jesus christ  
13	for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews  religion  how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god  and wasted it  
14	and profited in the jews  religion above many my equals in mine own nation  being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers  
15	but when it pleased god  who separated me from my mother s womb  and called  me  by his grace  
16	to reveal his son in me  that i might preach him among the heathen  immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood  
17	neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me  but i went into arabia  and returned again unto damascus  
18	then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter  and abode with him fifteen days  
19	but other of the apostles saw i none  save james the lord s brother  
20	now the things which i write unto you  behold  before god  i lie not  
21	afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia  
22	and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ  
23	but they had heard only  that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed  
24	and they glorified god in me  
galatians 2
1 	then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas  and took titus with  me  also  
2	and i went up by revelation  and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles  but privately to them which were of reputation  lest by any means i should run  or had run  in vain  
3	but neither titus  who was with me  being a greek  was compelled to be circumcised  
4	and that because of false brethren unawares brought in  who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus  that they might bring us into bondage  
5	to whom we gave place by subjection  no  not for an hour  that the truth of the gospel might continue with you  
6	but of these who seemed to be somewhat   whatsoever they were  it maketh no matter to me  god accepteth no man s person   for they who seemed  to be somewhat  in conference added nothing to me  
7	but contrariwise  when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me  as  the gospel  of the circumcision  was  unto peter  
8	 for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision  the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles   
9	and when james  cephas  and john  who seemed to be pillars  perceived the grace that was given unto me  they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship  that we  should go  unto the heathen  and they unto the circumcision  
10	only  they would  that we should remember the poor  the same which i also was forward to do  
11 	but when peter was come to antioch  i withstood him to the face  because he was to be blamed  
12	for before that certain came from james  he did eat with the gentiles  but when they were come  he withdrew and separated himself  fearing them which were of the circumcision  
13	and the other jews dissembled likewise with him  insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation  
14	but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel  i said unto peter before  them  all  if thou  being a jew  livest after the manner of gentiles  and not as do the jews  why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews  
15	we  who are  jews by nature  and not sinners of the gentiles  
16	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law  but by the faith of jesus christ  even we have believed in jesus christ  that we might be justified by the faith of christ  and not by the works of the law  for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified  
17	but if  while we seek to be justified by christ  we ourselves also are found sinners   is  therefore christ the minister of sin  god forbid  
18	for if i build again the things which i destroyed  i make myself a transgressor  
19	for i through the law am dead to the law  that i might live unto god  
20	i am crucified with christ  nevertheless i live  yet not i  but christ liveth in me  and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god  who loved me  and gave himself for me  
21	i do not frustrate the grace of god  for if righteousness  come  by the law  then christ is dead in vain  
galatians 3
1 	o foolish galatians  who hath bewitched you  that ye should not obey the truth  before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth  crucified among you  
2	this only would i learn of you  received ye the spirit by the works of the law  or by the hearing of faith  
3	are ye so foolish  having begun in the spirit  are ye now made perfect by the flesh  
4	have ye suffered so many things in vain  if  it be  yet in vain  
5	he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit  and worketh miracles among you   doeth he it  by the works of the law  or by the hearing of faith  
6 	even as abraham believed god  and it was accounted to him for righteousness  
7	know ye therefore that they which are of faith  the same are the children of abraham  
8	and the scripture  foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith  preached before the gospel unto abraham   saying   in thee shall all nations be blessed  
9	so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham  
10	for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse  for it is written  cursed  is  every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them  
11	but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god   it is  evident  for  the just shall live by faith  
12	and the law is not of faith  but  the man that doeth them shall live in them  
13	christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law  being made a curse for us  for it is written  cursed  is  every one that hangeth on a tree  
14	that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ  that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith  
15	brethren  i speak after the manner of men  though  it be  but a man s covenant  yet  if it be  confirmed  no man disannulleth  or addeth thereto  
16	now to abraham and his seed were the promises made  he saith not  and to seeds  as of many  but as of one  and to thy seed  which is christ  
17	and this i say   that  the covenant  that was confirmed before of god in christ  the law  which was four hundred and thirty years after  cannot disannul  that it should make the promise of none effect  
18	for if the inheritance  be  of the law   it is  no more of promise  but god gave  it  to abraham by promise  
19 	wherefore then  serveth  the law  it was added because of transgressions  till the seed should come to whom the promise was made   and it was  ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator  
20	now a mediator is not  a mediator  of one  but god is one  
21	 is  the law then against the promises of god  god forbid  for if there had been a law given which could have given life  verily righteousness should have been by the law  
22	but the scripture hath concluded all under sin  that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe  
23	but before faith came  we were kept under the law  shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed  
24	wherefore the law was our schoolmaster  to bring us  unto christ  that we might be justified by faith  
25	but after that faith is come  we are no longer under a schoolmaster  
26	for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus  
27	for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ  
28	there is neither jew nor greek  there is neither bond nor free  there is neither male nor female  for ye are all one in christ jesus  
29	and if ye  be  christ s  then are ye abraham s seed  and heirs according to the promise  
galatians 4
1 	now i say   that  the heir  as long as he is a child  differeth nothing from a servant  though he be lord of all  
2	but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father  
3	even so we  when we were children  were in bondage under the elements of the world  
4	but when the fulness of the time was come  god sent forth his son  made of a woman  made under the law  
5	to redeem them that were under the law  that we might receive the adoption of sons  
6	and because ye are sons  god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts  crying  abba  father  
7	wherefore thou art no more a servant  but a son  and if a son  then an heir of god through christ  
8 	howbeit then  when ye knew not god  ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods  
9	but now  after that ye have known god  or rather are known of god  how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements  whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage  
10	ye observe days  and months  and times  and years  
11	i am afraid of you  lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain  
12 	brethren  i beseech you  be as i  am   for i  am  as ye  are   ye have not injured me at all  
13	ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first  
14	and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not  nor rejected  but received me as an angel of god   even  as christ jesus  
15	where is then the blessedness ye spake of  for i bear you record  that  if  it had been  possible  ye would have plucked out your own eyes  and have given them to me  
16	am i therefore become your enemy  because i tell you the truth  
17 	they zealously affect you   but  not well  yea  they would exclude you  that ye might affect them  
18	but  it is  good to be zealously affected always in  a  good  thing   and not only when i am present with you  
19 	my little children  of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you  
20	i desire to be present with you now  and to change my voice  for i stand in doubt of you  
21 	tell me  ye that desire to be under the law  do ye not hear the law  
22	for it is written  that abraham had two sons  the one by a bondmaid  the other by a freewoman  
23	but he  who was  of the bondwoman was born after the flesh  but he of the freewoman  was  by promise  
24	which things are an allegory  for these are the two covenants  the one from the mount sinai  which gendereth to bondage  which is agar  
25	for this agar is mount sinai in arabia  and answereth to jerusalem which now is  and is in bondage with her children  
26	but jerusalem which is above is free  which is the mother of us all  
27	for it is written  rejoice   thou  barren that bearest not  break forth and cry  thou that travailest not  for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband  
28	now we  brethren  as isaac was  are the children of promise  
29	but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him  that was born  after the spirit  even so  it is  now  
30	nevertheless what saith the scripture  cast out the bondwoman and her son  for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman  
31	so then  brethren  we are not children of the bondwoman  but of the free  
galatians 5
1 	stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free  and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage  
2	behold  i paul say unto you  that if ye be circumcised  christ shall profit you nothing  
3	for i testify again to every man that is circumcised  that he is a debtor to do the whole law  
4	christ is become of no effect unto you  whosoever of you are justified by the law  ye are fallen from grace  
5	for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith  
6	for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing  nor uncircumcision  but faith which worketh by love  
7	ye did run well  who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth  
8	this persuasion  cometh  not of him that calleth you  
9	a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump  
10	i have confidence in you through the lord  that ye will be none otherwise minded  but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment  whosoever he be  
11	and i  brethren  if i yet preach circumcision  why do i yet suffer persecution  then is the offence of the cross ceased  
12	i would they were even cut off which trouble you  
13 	for  brethren  ye have been called unto liberty  only  use  not liberty for an occasion to the flesh  but by love serve one another  
14	for all the law is fulfilled in one word   even  in this  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  
15	but if ye bite and devour one another  take heed that ye be not consumed one of another  
16	 this  i say then  walk in the spirit  and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh  
17	for the flesh lusteth against the spirit  and the spirit against the flesh  and these are contrary the one to the other  so that ye cannot do the things that ye would  
18	but if ye be led of the spirit  ye are not under the law  
19	now the works of the flesh are manifest  which are  these   adultery  fornication  uncleanness  lasciviousness  
20	idolatry  witchcraft  hatred  variance  emulations  wrath  strife  seditions  heresies  
21	envyings  murders  drunkenness  revellings  and such like  of the which i tell you before  as i have also told  you  in time past  that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god  
22	but the fruit of the spirit is love  joy  peace  longsuffering  gentleness  goodness  faith  
23	meekness  temperance  against such there is no law  
24	and they that are christ s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts  
25	if we live in the spirit  let us also walk in the spirit  
26	let us not be desirous of vain glory  provoking one another  envying one another  
galatians 6
1 	brethren  if a man be overtaken in a fault  ye which are spiritual  restore such an one in the spirit of meekness  considering thyself  lest thou also be tempted  
2	bear ye one another s burdens  and so fulfil the law of christ  
3	for if a man think himself to be something  when he is nothing  he deceiveth himself  
4	but let every man prove his own work  and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone  and not in another  
5	for every man shall bear his own burden  
6	let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things  
7	be not deceived  god is not mocked  for whatsoever a man soweth  that shall he also reap  
8	for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption  but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting  
9	and let us not be weary in well doing  for in due season we shall reap  if we faint not  
10	as we have therefore opportunity  let us do good unto all  men   especially unto them who are of the household of faith  
11 	ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand  
12	as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh  they constrain you to be circumcised  only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ  
13	for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law  but desire to have you circumcised  that they may glory in your flesh  
14	but god forbid that i should glory  save in the cross of our lord jesus christ  by whom the world is crucified unto me  and i unto the world  
15	for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing  nor uncircumcision  but a new creature  
16	and as many as walk according to this rule  peace  be  on them  and mercy  and upon the israel of god  
17	from henceforth let no man trouble me  for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus  
18	brethren  the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with your spirit  amen    to  the  galatians written from rome

ephesians 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god  to the saints which are at ephesus  and to the faithful in christ jesus  
2	grace  be  to you  and peace  from god our father  and  from  the lord jesus christ  
3 	blessed  be  the god and father of our lord jesus christ  who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly  places  in christ  
4	according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world  that we should be holy and without blame before him in love  
5	having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself  according to the good pleasure of his will  
6	to the praise of the glory of his grace  wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved  
7	in whom we have redemption through his blood  the forgiveness of sins  according to the riches of his grace  
8	wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence  
9	having made known unto us the mystery of his will  according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself  
10	that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ  both which are in heaven  and which are on earth   even  in him  
11	in whom also we have obtained an inheritance  being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will  
12	that we should be to the praise of his glory  who first trusted in christ  
13	in whom ye also  trusted   after that ye heard the word of truth  the gospel of your salvation  in whom also after that ye believed  ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise  
14	which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession  unto the praise of his glory  
15 	wherefore i also  after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus  and love unto all the saints  
16	cease not to give thanks for you  making mention of you in my prayers  
17	that the god of our lord jesus christ  the father of glory  may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him  
18	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened  that ye may know what is the hope of his calling  and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints  
19	and what  is  the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe  according to the working of his mighty power  
20	which he wrought in christ  when he raised him from the dead  and set  him  at his own right hand in the heavenly  places   
21	far above all principality  and power  and might  and dominion  and every name that is named  not only in this world  but also in that which is to come  
22	and hath put all  things  under his feet  and gave him  to be  the head over all  things  to the church  
23	which is his body  the fulness of him that filleth all in all  
ephesians 2
1 	and you  hath he quickened   who were dead in trespasses and sins  
2	wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world  according to the prince of the power of the air  the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience  
3	among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh  fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind  and were by nature the children of wrath  even as others  
4 	but god  who is rich in mercy  for his great love wherewith he loved us  
5	even when we were dead in sins  hath quickened us together with christ   by grace ye are saved   
6	and hath raised  us  up together  and made  us  sit together in heavenly  places  in christ jesus  
7	that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in  his  kindness toward us through christ jesus  
8	for by grace are ye saved through faith  and that not of yourselves   it is  the gift of god  
9	not of works  lest any man should boast  
10	for we are his workmanship  created in christ jesus unto good works  which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them  
11 	wherefore remember  that ye  being  in time past gentiles in the flesh  who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands  
12	that at that time ye were without christ  being aliens from the commonwealth of israel  and strangers from the covenants of promise  having no hope  and without god in the world  
13	but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ  
14 	for he is our peace  who hath made both one  and hath broken down the middle wall of partition  between us   
15	having abolished in his flesh the enmity   even  the law of commandments  contained  in ordinances  for to make in himself of twain one new man   so  making peace  
16	and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross  having slain the enmity thereby  
17	and came and preached peace to you which were afar off  and to them that were nigh  
18	for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father  
19	now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners  but fellowcitizens with the saints  and of the household of god  
20	and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets  jesus christ himself being the chief corner  stone   
21	in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord  
22	in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit  
ephesians 3
1 	for this cause i paul  the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles  
2	if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you ward  
3	how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery   as i wrote afore in few words  
4	whereby  when ye read  ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ  
5	which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men  as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit  
6	that the gentiles should be fellowheirs  and of the same body  and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel  
7	whereof i was made a minister  according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power  
8	unto me  who am less than the least of all saints  is this grace given  that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ  
9	and to make all  men  see what  is  the fellowship of the mystery  which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god  who created all things by jesus christ  
10	to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly  places  might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god  
11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord  
12	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him  
13	wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you  which is your glory  
14 	for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ  
15	of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named  
16	that he would grant you  according to the riches of his glory  to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man  
17	that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith  that ye  being rooted and grounded in love  
18	may be able to comprehend with all saints what  is  the breadth  and length  and depth  and height  
19	and to know the love of christ  which passeth knowledge  that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god  
20	now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think  according to the power that worketh in us  
21	unto him  be  glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages  world without end  amen  
ephesians 4
1 	i therefore  the prisoner of the lord  beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called  
2 	with all lowliness and meekness  with longsuffering  forbearing one another in love  
3	endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace  
4	 there is  one body  and one spirit  even as ye are called in one hope of your calling  
5	one lord  one faith  one baptism  
6	one god and father of all  who  is  above all  and through all  and in you all  
7	but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ  
8	wherefore he saith  when he ascended up on high  he led captivity captive  and gave gifts unto men  
9	 now that he ascended  what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth  
10	he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens  that he might fill all things   
11	and he gave some  apostles  and some  prophets  and some  evangelists  and some  pastors and teachers  
12	for the perfecting of the saints  for the work of the ministry  for the edifying of the body of christ  
13	till we all come in the unity of the faith  and of the knowledge of the son of god  unto a perfect man  unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  
14	that we  henceforth  be no more children  tossed to and fro  and carried about with every wind of doctrine  by the sleight of men   and  cunning craftiness  whereby they lie in wait to deceive  
15	but speaking the truth in love  may grow up into him in all things  which is the head   even  christ  
16	from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth  according to the effectual working in the measure of every part  maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love  
17 	this i say therefore  and testify in the lord  that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk  in the vanity of their mind  
18	having the understanding darkened  being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them  because of the blindness of their heart  
19	who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness  to work all uncleanness with greediness  
20	but ye have not so learned christ  
21	if so be that ye have heard him  and have been taught by him  as the truth is in jesus  
22	that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man  which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts  
23	and be renewed in the spirit of your mind  
24	and that ye put on the new man  which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness  
25	wherefore putting away lying  speak every man truth with his neighbour  for we are members one of another  
26	be ye angry  and sin not  let not the sun go down upon your wrath  
27	neither give place to the devil  
28	let him that stole steal no more  but rather let him labour  working with  his  hands the thing which is good  that he may have to give to him that needeth  
29	let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth  but that which is good to the use of edifying  that it may minister grace unto the hearers  
30	and grieve not the holy spirit of god  whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption  
31	let all bitterness  and wrath  and anger  and clamour  and evil speaking  be put away from you  with all malice  
32	and be ye kind one to another  tenderhearted  forgiving one another  even as god for christ s sake hath forgiven you  
ephesians 5
1 	be ye therefore followers of god  as dear children  
2	and walk in love  as christ also hath loved us  and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour  
3 	but fornication  and all uncleanness  or covetousness  let it not be once named among you  as becometh saints  
4	neither filthiness  nor foolish talking  nor jesting  which are not convenient  but rather giving of thanks  
5	for this ye know  that no whoremonger  nor unclean person  nor covetous man  who is an idolater  hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god  
6	let no man deceive you with vain words  for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience  
7	be not ye therefore partakers with them  
8	for ye were sometimes darkness  but now  are ye  light in the lord  walk as children of light  
9	 for the fruit of the spirit  is  in all goodness and righteousness and truth   
10	proving what is acceptable unto the lord  
11	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness  but rather reprove  them   
12	for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret  
13	but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light  for whatsoever doth make manifest is light  
14	wherefore he saith  awake thou that sleepest  and arise from the dead  and christ shall give thee light  
15	see then that ye walk circumspectly  not as fools  but as wise  
16	redeeming the time  because the days are evil  
17	wherefore be ye not unwise  but understanding what the will of the lord  is   
18	and be not drunk with wine  wherein is excess  but be filled with the spirit  
19	speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs  singing and making melody in your heart to the lord  
20	giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ  
21 	submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god  
22	wives  submit yourselves unto your own husbands  as unto the lord  
23	for the husband is the head of the wife  even as christ is the head of the church  and he is the saviour of the body  
24	therefore as the church is subject unto christ  so  let  the wives  be  to their own husbands in every thing  
25	husbands  love your wives  even as christ also loved the church  and gave himself for it  
26	that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word  
27	that he might present it to himself a glorious church  not having spot  or wrinkle  or any such thing  but that it should be holy and without blemish  
28	so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies  he that loveth his wife loveth himself  
29	for no man ever yet hated his own flesh  but nourisheth and cherisheth it  even as the lord the church  
30	for we are members of his body  of his flesh  and of his bones  
31	for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother  and shall be joined unto his wife  and they two shall be one flesh  
32	this is a great mystery  but i speak concerning christ and the church  
33	nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself  and the wife  see  that she reverence  her  husband  
ephesians 6
1 	children  obey your parents in the lord  for this is right  
2	honour thy father and mother   which is the first commandment with promise   
3	that it may be well with thee  and thou mayest live long on the earth  
4	and  ye fathers  provoke not your children to wrath  but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord  
5	servants  be obedient to them that are  your  masters according to the flesh  with fear and trembling  in singleness of your heart  as unto christ  
6	not with eyeservice  as menpleasers  but as the servants of christ  doing the will of god from the heart  
7	with good will doing service  as to the lord  and not to men  
8	knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth  the same shall he receive of the lord  whether  he be  bond or free  
9	and  ye masters  do the same things unto them  forbearing threatening  knowing that your master also is in heaven  neither is there respect of persons with him  
10 	finally  my brethren  be strong in the lord  and in the power of his might  
11	put on the whole armour of god  that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil  
12	for we wrestle not against flesh and blood  but against principalities  against powers  against the rulers of the darkness of this world  against spiritual wickedness in high  places   
13	wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god  that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day  and having done all  to stand  
14	stand therefore  having your loins girt about with truth  and having on the breastplate of righteousness  
15	and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace  
16	above all  taking the shield of faith  wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked  
17	and take the helmet of salvation  and the sword of the spirit  which is the word of god  
18	praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit  and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints  
19 	and for me  that utterance may be given unto me  that i may open my mouth boldly  to make known the mystery of the gospel  
20	for which i am an ambassador in bonds  that therein i may speak boldly  as i ought to speak  
21	but that ye also may know my affairs   and  how i do  tychicus  a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord  shall make known to you all things  
22	whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose  that ye might know our affairs  and  that  he might comfort your hearts  
23	peace  be  to the brethren  and love with faith  from god the father and the lord jesus christ  
24	grace  be  with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity  amen    to  the  ephesians written from rome  by tychicus   

philippians
philippians 1
1 	paul and timotheus  the servants of jesus christ  to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi  with the bishops and deacons  
2	grace  be  unto you  and peace  from god our father  and  from  the lord jesus christ  
3 	i thank my god upon every remembrance of you  
4	always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy  
5	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now  
6	being confident of this very thing  that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform  it  until the day of jesus christ  
7 	even as it is meet for me to think this of you all  because i have you in my heart  inasmuch as both in my bonds  and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel  ye all are partakers of my grace  
8	for god is my record  how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ  
9 	and this i pray  that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and  in  all judgment  
10	that ye may approve things that are excellent  that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ  
11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness  which are by jesus christ  unto the glory and praise of god  
12 	but i would ye should understand  brethren  that the things  which happened  unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel  
13	so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace  and in all other  places   
14	and many of the brethren in the lord  waxing confident by my bonds  are much more bold to speak the word without fear  
15	some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife  and some also of good will  
16	the one preach christ of contention  not sincerely  supposing to add affliction to my bonds  
17	but the other of love  knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel  
18	what then  notwithstanding  every way  whether in pretence  or in truth  christ is preached  and i therein do rejoice  yea  and will rejoice  
19	for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer  and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ  
20	according to my earnest expectation and  my  hope  that in nothing i shall be ashamed  but  that  with all boldness  as always   so  now also christ shall be magnified in my body  whether  it be  by life  or by death  
21 	for to me to live  is  christ  and to die  is  gain  
22	but if i live in the flesh  this  is  the fruit of my labour  yet what i shall choose i wot not  
23	for i am in a strait betwixt two  having a desire to depart  and to be with christ  which is far better  
24	nevertheless to abide in the flesh  is  more needful for you  
25	and having this confidence  i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith  
26	that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again  
27 	only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ  that whether i come and see you  or else be absent  i may hear of your affairs  that ye stand fast in one spirit  with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel  
28	and in nothing terrified by your adversaries  which is to them an evident token of perdition  but to you of salvation  and that of god  
29	for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ  not only to believe on him  but also to suffer for his sake  
30	having the same conflict which ye saw in me  and now hear  to be  in me  
philippians 2
1 	if  there be  therefore any consolation in christ  if any comfort of love  if any fellowship of the spirit  if any bowels and mercies  
2	fulfil ye my joy  that ye be likeminded  having the same love   being  of one accord  of one mind  
3	 let  nothing  be done  through strife or vainglory  but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves  
4	look not every man on his own things  but every man also on the things of others  
5	let this mind be in you  which was also in christ jesus  
6	who  being in the form of god  thought it not robbery to be equal with god  
7	but made himself of no reputation  and took upon him the form of a servant  and was made in the likeness of men  
8	and being found in fashion as a man  he humbled himself  and became obedient unto death  even the death of the cross  
9	wherefore god also hath highly exalted him  and given him a name which is above every name  
10	that at the name of jesus every knee should bow  of  things  in heaven  and  things  in earth  and  things  under the earth  
11	and  that  every tongue should confess that jesus christ  is  lord  to the glory of god the father  
12 	wherefore  my beloved  as ye have always obeyed  not as in my presence only  but now much more in my absence  work out your own salvation with fear and trembling  
13	for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of  his  good pleasure  
14 	do all things without murmurings and disputings  
15	that ye may be blameless and harmless  the sons of god  without rebuke  in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation  among whom ye shine as lights in the world  
16	holding forth the word of life  that i may rejoice in the day of christ  that i have not run in vain  neither laboured in vain  
17	yea  and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith  i joy  and rejoice with you all  
18	for the same cause also do ye joy  and rejoice with me  
19	but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you  that i also may be of good comfort  when i know your state  
20	for i have no man likeminded  who will naturally care for your state  
21	for all seek their own  not the things which are jesus christ s  
22	but ye know the proof of him  that  as a son with the father  he hath served with me in the gospel  
23	him therefore i hope to send presently  so soon as i shall see how it will go with me  
24	but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly  
25	yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus  my brother  and companion in labour  and fellowsoldier  but your messenger  and he that ministered to my wants  
26	for he longed after you all  and was full of heaviness  because that ye had heard that he had been sick  
27	for indeed he was sick nigh unto death  but god had mercy on him  and not on him only  but on me also  lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow  
28	i sent him therefore the more carefully  that  when ye see him again  ye may rejoice  and that i may be the less sorrowful  
29	receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness  and hold such in reputation  
30	because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death  not regarding his life  to supply your lack of service toward me  
philippians 3
1 	finally  my brethren  rejoice in the lord  to write the same things to you  to me indeed  is  not grievous  but for you  it is  safe  
2	beware of dogs  beware of evil workers  beware of the concision  
3	for we are the circumcision  which worship god in the spirit  and rejoice in christ jesus  and have no confidence in the flesh  
4 	though i might also have confidence in the flesh  if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh  i more  
5	circumcised the eighth day  of the stock of israel   of  the tribe of benjamin  an hebrew of the hebrews  as touching the law  a pharisee  
6	concerning zeal  persecuting the church  touching the righteousness which is in the law  blameless  
7	but what things were gain to me  those i counted loss for christ  
8	yea doubtless  and i count all things  but  loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord  for whom i have suffered the loss of all things  and do count them  but  dung  that i may win christ  
9 	and be found in him  not having mine own righteousness  which is of the law  but that which is through the faith of christ  the righteousness which is of god by faith  
10	that i may know him  and the power of his resurrection  and the fellowship of his sufferings  being made conformable unto his death  
11	if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead  
12	not as though i had already attained  either were already perfect  but i follow after  if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus  
13	brethren  i count not myself to have apprehended  but  this  one thing  i do   forgetting those things which are behind  and reaching forth unto those things which are before  
14	i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus  
15 	let us therefore  as many as be perfect  be thus minded  and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded  god shall reveal even this unto you  
16	nevertheless  whereto we have already attained  let us walk by the same rule  let us mind the same thing  
17 	brethren  be followers together of me  and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample  
18	 for many walk  of whom i have told you often  and now tell you even weeping   that they are  the enemies of the cross of christ  
19	whose end  is  destruction  whose god  is their  belly  and  whose  glory  is  in their shame  who mind earthly things   
20	for our conversation is in heaven  from whence also we look for the saviour  the lord jesus christ  
21	who shall change our vile body  that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body  according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself  
philippians 4
1 	therefore  my brethren dearly beloved and longed for  my joy and crown  so stand fast in the lord   my  dearly beloved  
2	i beseech euodias  and beseech syntyche  that they be of the same mind in the lord  
3	and i intreat thee also  true yokefellow  help those women which laboured with me in the gospel  with clement also  and  with  other my fellowlabourers  whose names  are  in the book of life  
4	rejoice in the lord alway   and  again i say  rejoice  
5	let your moderation be known unto all men  the lord  is  at hand  
6	be careful for nothing  but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god  
7	and the peace of god  which passeth all understanding  shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus  
8	finally  brethren  whatsoever things are true  whatsoever things  are  honest  whatsoever things  are  just  whatsoever things  are  pure  whatsoever things  are  lovely  whatsoever things  are  of good report  if  there be  any virtue  and if  there be  any praise  think on these things  
9	those things  which ye have both learned  and received  and heard  and seen in me  do  and the god of peace shall be with you  
10 	but i rejoiced in the lord greatly  that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again  wherein ye were also careful  but ye lacked opportunity  
11	not that i speak in respect of want  for i have learned  in whatsoever state i am   therewith  to be content  
12	i know both how to be abased  and i know how to abound  every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry  both to abound and to suffer need  
13	i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me  
14	notwithstanding ye have well done  that ye did communicate with my affliction  
15	now ye philippians know also  that in the beginning of the gospel  when i departed from macedonia  no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving  but ye only  
16	for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity  
17	not because i desire a gift  but i desire fruit that may abound to your account  
18	but i have all  and abound  i am full  having received of epaphroditus the things  which were sent  from you  an odour of a sweet smell  a sacrifice acceptable  wellpleasing to god  
19	but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus  
20 	now unto god and our father  be  glory for ever and ever  amen  
21	salute every saint in christ jesus  the brethren which are with me greet you  
22	all the saints salute you  chiefly they that are of caesar s household  
23	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you all  amen    to  the  philippians written from rome  by epaphroditus   

colossians
colossians 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god  and timotheus  our  brother  
2	to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse  grace  be  unto you  and peace  from god our father and the lord jesus christ  
3 	we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ  praying always for you  
4	since we heard of your faith in christ jesus  and of the love  which ye have  to all the saints  
5	for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven  whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel  
6	which is come unto you  as  it is  in all the world  and bringeth forth fruit  as  it doth  also in you  since the day ye heard  of it   and knew the grace of god in truth  
7	as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant  who is for you a faithful minister of christ  
8	who also declared unto us your love in the spirit  
9 	for this cause we also  since the day we heard  it   do not cease to pray for you  and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding  
10	that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing  being fruitful in every good work  and increasing in the knowledge of god  
11	strengthened with all might  according to his glorious power  unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness  
12 	giving thanks unto the father  which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light  
13	who hath delivered us from the power of darkness  and hath translated  us  into the kingdom of his dear son  
14	in whom we have redemption through his blood   even  the forgiveness of sins  
15	who is the image of the invisible god  the firstborn of every creature  
16	for by him were all things created  that are in heaven  and that are in earth  visible and invisible  whether  they be  thrones  or dominions  or principalities  or powers  all things were created by him  and for him  
17	and he is before all things  and by him all things consist  
18	and he is the head of the body  the church  who is the beginning  the firstborn from the dead  that in all  things  he might have the preeminence  
19	for it pleased  the father  that in him should all fulness dwell  
20	and  having made peace through the blood of his cross  by him to reconcile all things unto himself  by him   i say   whether  they be  things in earth  or things in heaven  
21	and you  that were sometime alienated and enemies in  your  mind by wicked works  yet now hath he reconciled 
22	in the body of his flesh through death  to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight  
23	if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled  and  be  not moved away from the hope of the gospel  which ye have heard   and  which was preached to every creature which is under heaven  whereof i paul am made a minister  
24	who now rejoice in my sufferings for you  and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body s sake  which is the church  
25	whereof i am made a minister  according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you  to fulfil the word of god  
26	 even  the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations  but now is made manifest to his saints  
27	to whom god would make known what  is  the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles  which is christ in you  the hope of glory  
28	whom we preach  warning every man  and teaching every man in all wisdom  that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus  
29	whereunto i also labour  striving according to his working  which worketh in me mightily  
colossians 2
1 	for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you  and  for  them at laodicea  and  for  as many as have not seen my face in the flesh  
2	that their hearts might be comforted  being knit together in love  and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding  to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god  and of the father  and of christ  
3	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge  
4 	and this i say  lest any man should beguile you with enticing words  
5	for though i be absent in the flesh  yet am i with you in the spirit  joying and beholding your order  and the stedfastness of your faith in christ  
6	as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord   so  walk ye in him  
7	rooted and built up in him  and stablished in the faith  as ye have been taught  abounding therein with thanksgiving  
8	beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit  after the tradition of men  after the rudiments of the world  and not after christ  
9	for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily  
10	and ye are complete in him  which is the head of all principality and power  
11	in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands  in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ  
12	buried with him in baptism  wherein also ye are risen with  him  through the faith of the operation of god  who hath raised him from the dead  
13 	and you  being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh  hath he quickened together with him  having forgiven you all trespasses  
14	blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us  which was contrary to us  and took it out of the way  nailing it to his cross  
15	 and  having spoiled principalities and powers  he made a shew of them openly  triumphing over them in it  
16 	let no man therefore judge you in meat  or in drink  or in respect of an holyday  or of the new moon  or of the sabbath  days   
17	which are a shadow of things to come  but the body  is  of christ  
18	let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels  intruding into those things which he hath not seen  vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind  
19	and not holding the head  from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered  and knit together  increaseth with the increase of god  
20	wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world  why  as though living in the world  are ye subject to ordinances  
21	 touch not  taste not  handle not  
22	which all are to perish with the using   after the commandments and doctrines of men  
23	which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship  and humility  and neglecting of the body  not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh  
colossians 3
1 	if ye then be risen with christ  seek those things which are above  where christ sitteth on the right hand of god  
2	set your affection on things above  not on things on the earth  
3	for ye are dead  and your life is hid with christ in god  
4	when christ   who is  our life  shall appear  then shall ye also appear with him in glory  
5 	mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth  fornication  uncleanness  inordinate affection  evil concupiscence  and covetousness  which is idolatry  
6	for which things  sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience  
7	in the which ye also walked some time  when ye lived in them  
8 	but now ye also put off all these  anger  wrath  malice  blasphemy  filthy communication out of your mouth  
9	lie not one to another  seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds  
10	and have put on the new  man   which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him  
11	where there is neither greek nor jew  circumcision nor uncircumcision  barbarian  scythian  bond  nor  free  but christ  is  all  and in all  
12 	put on therefore  as the elect of god  holy and beloved  bowels of mercies  kindness  humbleness of mind  meekness  longsuffering  
13	forbearing one another  and forgiving one another  if any man have a quarrel against any  even as christ forgave you  so also  do  ye  
14	and above all these things  put on  charity  which is the bond of perfectness  
15	and let the peace of god rule in your hearts  to the which also ye are called in one body  and be ye thankful  
16	let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom  teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs  singing with grace in your hearts to the lord  
17	and whatsoever ye do in word or deed   do  all in the name of the lord jesus  giving thanks to god and the father by him  
18 	wives  submit yourselves unto your own husbands  as it is fit in the lord  
19	husbands  love  your  wives  and be not bitter against them  
20	children  obey  your  parents in all things  for this is well pleasing unto the lord  
21	fathers  provoke not your children  to anger   lest they be discouraged  
22	servants  obey in all things  your  masters according to the flesh  not with eyeservice  as menpleasers  but in singleness of heart  fearing god  
23	and whatsoever ye do  do  it  heartily  as to the lord  and not unto men  
24	knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance  for ye serve the lord christ  
25	but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done  and there is no respect of persons

1 	masters  give unto  your  servants that which is just and equal  knowing that ye also have a master in heaven  
2 	continue in prayer  and watch in the same with thanksgiving  
3	withal praying also for us  that god would open unto us a door of utterance  to speak the mystery of christ  for which i am also in bonds  
4	that i may make it manifest  as i ought to speak

1 thessalonians
1 thessalonians 1
1 	paul  and silvanus  and timotheus  unto the church of the thessalonians  which is  in god the father and  in  the lord jesus christ  grace  be  unto you  and peace  from god our father  and the lord jesus christ  
2 	we give thanks to god always for you all  making mention of you in our prayers  
3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith  and labour of love  and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ  in the sight of god and our father  
4	knowing  brethren beloved  your election of god  
5	for our gospel came not unto you in word only  but also in power  and in the holy ghost  and in much assurance  as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake  
6 	and ye became followers of us  and of the lord  having received the word in much affliction  with joy of the holy ghost  
7	so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia  
8	for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia  but also in every place your faith to god ward is spread abroad  so that we need not to speak any thing  
9	for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you  and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god  
10	and to wait for his son from heaven  whom he raised from the dead   even  jesus  which delivered us from the wrath to come  
1 thessalonians 2
1 	for yourselves  brethren  know our entrance in unto you  that it was not in vain  
2	but even after that we had suffered before  and were shamefully entreated  as ye know  at philippi  we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention  
3	for our exhortation  was  not of deceit  nor of uncleanness  nor in guile  
4	but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel  even so we speak  not as pleasing men  but god  which trieth our hearts  
5	for neither at any time used we flattering words  as ye know  nor a cloke of covetousness  god  is  witness  
6	nor of men sought we glory  neither of you  nor  yet  of others  when we might have been burdensome  as the apostles of christ  
7 	but we were gentle among you  even as a nurse cherisheth her children  
8	so being affectionately desirous of you  we were willing to have imparted unto you  not the gospel of god only  but also our own souls  because ye were dear unto us  
9	for ye remember  brethren  our labour and travail  for labouring night and day  because we would not be chargeable unto any of you  we preached unto you the gospel of god  
10	ye  are  witnesses  and god  also   how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe  
11	as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you  as a father  doth  his children  
12	that ye would walk worthy of god  who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory  
13 	for this cause also thank we god without ceasing  because  when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us  ye received  it  not  as  the word of men  but as it is in truth  the word of god  which effectually worketh also in you that believe  
14	for ye  brethren  became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus  for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen  even as they  have  of the jews  
15	who both killed the lord jesus  and their own prophets  and have persecuted us  and they please not god  and are contrary to all men  
16	forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved  to fill up their sins alway  for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost  
17 	but we  brethren  being taken from you for a short time in presence  not in heart  endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire  
18	wherefore we would have come unto you  even i paul  once and again  but satan hindered us  
19	for what  is  our hope  or joy  or crown of rejoicing   are  not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming  
20	for ye are our glory and joy  
1 thessalonians 3
1 	wherefore when we could no longer forbear  we thought it good to be left at athens alone  
2	and sent timotheus  our brother  and minister of god  and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ  to establish you  and to comfort you concerning your faith  
3	that no man should be moved by these afflictions  for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto  
4	for verily  when we were with you  we told you before that we should suffer tribulation  even as it came to pass  and ye know  
5	for this cause  when i could no longer forbear  i sent to know your faith  lest by some means the tempter have tempted you  and our labour be in vain  
6 	but now when timotheus came from you unto us  and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity  and that ye have good remembrance of us always  desiring greatly to see us  as we also  to see  you  
7	therefore  brethren  we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith  
8	for now we live  if ye stand fast in the lord  
9	for what thanks can we render to god again for you  for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god  
10	night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face  and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith  
11 	now god himself and our father  and our lord jesus christ  direct our way unto you  
12	and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another  and toward all  men   even as we  do  toward you  
13	to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god  even our father  at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints  
1 thessalonians 4
1 	furthermore then we beseech you  brethren  and exhort  you  by the lord jesus  that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god   so  ye would abound more and more  
2	for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus  
3	for this is the will of god   even  your sanctification  that ye should abstain from fornication  
4	that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour  
5	not in the lust of concupiscence  even as the gentiles which know not god  
6	that no  man  go beyond and defraud his brother in  any  matter  because that the lord  is  the avenger of all such  as we also have forewarned you and testified  
7	for god hath not called us unto uncleanness  but unto holiness  
8	he therefore that despiseth  despiseth not man  but god  who hath also given unto us his holy spirit  
9 	but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you  for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another  
10	and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia  but we beseech you  brethren  that ye increase more and more  
11	and that ye study to be quiet  and to do your own business  and to work with your own hands  as we commanded you  
12	that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without  and  that  ye may have lack of nothing  
13 	but i would not have you to be ignorant  brethren  concerning them which are asleep  that ye sorrow not  even as others which have no hope  
14	for if we believe that jesus died and rose again  even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him  
15	for this we say unto you by the word of the lord  that we which are alive  and  remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep  
16	for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout  with the voice of the archangel  and with the trump of god  and the dead in christ shall rise first  
17	then we which are alive  and  remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds  to meet the lord in the air  and so shall we ever be with the lord  
18	wherefore comfort one another with these words  
1 thessalonians 5
1 	but of the times and the seasons  brethren  ye have no need that i write unto you  
2	for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night  
3	for when they shall say  peace and safety  then sudden destruction cometh upon them  as travail upon a woman with child  and they shall not escape  
4	but ye  brethren  are not in darkness  that that day should overtake you as a thief  
5	ye are all the children of light  and the children of the day  we are not of the night  nor of darkness  
6 	therefore let us not sleep  as  do  others  but let us watch and be sober  
7	for they that sleep sleep in the night  and they that be drunken are drunken in the night  
8	but let us  who are of the day  be sober  putting on the breastplate of faith and love  and for an helmet  the hope of salvation  
9	for god hath not appointed us to wrath  but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ  
10	who died for us  that  whether we wake or sleep  we should live together with him  
11 	wherefore comfort yourselves together  and edify one another  even as also ye do  
12	and we beseech you  brethren  to know them which labour among you  and are over you in the lord  and admonish you  
13	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work s sake   and  be at peace among yourselves  
14	now we exhort you  brethren  warn them that are unruly  comfort the feebleminded  support the weak  be patient toward all  men   
15	see that none render evil for evil unto any  man   but ever follow that which is good  both among yourselves  and to all  men   
16 	rejoice evermore  
17	pray without ceasing  
18	in every thing give thanks  for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you  
19	quench not the spirit  
20	despise not prophesyings  
21	prove all things  hold fast that which is good  
22	abstain from all appearance of evil  
23 	and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly  and  i pray god  your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ  
24	faithful  is  he that calleth you  who also will do  it   
25	brethren  pray for us  
26	greet all the brethren with an holy kiss  
27	i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren  
28	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you  amen    the first  epistle  to the thessalonians was written from athens   

2 thessalonians
2 thessalonians 1
1 	paul  and silvanus  and timotheus  unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ  
2	grace unto you  and peace  from god our father and the lord jesus christ  
3	we are bound to thank god always for you  brethren  as it is meet  because that your faith groweth exceedingly  and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth  
4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure  
5 	 which is  a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god  that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god  for which ye also suffer  
6	seeing  it is  a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you  
7	and to you who are troubled rest with us  when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels  
8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god  and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ  
9	who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord  and from the glory of his power  
10	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints  and to be admired in all them that believe  because our testimony among you was believed  in that day  
11 	wherefore also we pray always for you  that our god would count you worthy of  this  calling  and fulfil all the good pleasure of  his  goodness  and the work of faith with power  
12	that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you  and ye in him  according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ  
2 thessalonians 2
1 	now we beseech you  brethren  by the coming of our lord jesus christ  and  by  our gathering together unto him  
2	that ye be not soon shaken in mind  or be troubled  neither by spirit  nor by word  nor by letter as from us  as that the day of christ is at hand  
3 	let no man deceive you by any means  for  that day shall not come   except there come a falling away first  and that man of sin be revealed  the son of perdition  
4	who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god  or that is worshipped  so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god  shewing himself that he is god  
5	remember ye not  that  when i was yet with you  i told you these things  
6	and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time  
7	for the mystery of iniquity doth already work  only he who now letteth  will let   until he be taken out of the way  
8	and then shall that wicked be revealed  whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth  and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming  
9	 even him   whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders  
10	and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish  because they received not the love of the truth  that they might be saved  
11	and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion  that they should believe a lie  
12	that they all might be damned who believed not the truth  but had pleasure in unrighteousness  
13 	but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you  brethren beloved of the lord  because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth  
14	whereunto he called you by our gospel  to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ  
15	therefore  brethren  stand fast  and hold the traditions which ye have been taught  whether by word  or our epistle  
16 	now our lord jesus christ himself  and god  even our father  which hath loved us  and hath given  us  everlasting consolation and good hope through grace  
17	comfort your hearts  and stablish you in every good word and work  
2 thessalonians 3
1 	finally  brethren  pray for us  that the word of the lord may have  free  course  and be glorified  even as  it is  with you  
2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men  for all  men  have not faith  
3	but the lord is faithful  who shall stablish you  and keep  you  from evil  
4	and we have confidence in the lord touching you  that ye both do and will do the things which we command you  
5	and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god  and into the patient waiting for christ  
6 	now we command you  brethren  in the name of our lord jesus christ  that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly  and not after the tradition which he received of us  
7	for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us  for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you  
8	neither did we eat any man s bread for nought  but wrought with labour and travail night and day  that we might not be chargeable to any of you  
9	not because we have not power  but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us  
10	for even when we were with you  this we commanded you  that if any would not work  neither should he eat  
11	for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly  working not at all  but are busybodies  
12	now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ  that with quietness they work  and eat their own bread  
13	but ye  brethren  be not weary in well doing  
14	and if any man obey not our word by this epistle  note that man  and have no company with him  that he may be ashamed  
15	yet count  him  not as an enemy  but admonish  him  as a brother  
16 	now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means  the lord  be  with you all  
17	the salutation of paul with mine own hand  which is the token in every epistle  so i write  
18	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you all  amen    the second  epistle  to the thessalonians was written from athens   

1 timothy
1 timothy 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour  and lord jesus christ   which is  our hope  
2	unto timothy   my  own son in the faith  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god our father and jesus christ our lord  
3	as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus  when i went into macedonia  that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine  
4	neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies  which minister questions  rather than godly edifying which is in faith   so do   
5 	now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart  and  of  a good conscience  and  of  faith unfeigned  
6	from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling  
7	desiring to be teachers of the law  understanding neither what they say  nor whereof they affirm  
8	but we know that the law  is  good  if a man use it lawfully  
9	knowing this  that the law is not made for a righteous man  but for the lawless and disobedient  for the ungodly and for sinners  for unholy and profane  for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers  for manslayers  
10	for whoremongers  for them that defile themselves with mankind  for menstealers  for liars  for perjured persons  and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine  
11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god  which was committed to my trust  
12 	and i thank christ jesus our lord  who hath enabled me  for that he counted me faithful  putting me into the ministry  
13	who was before a blasphemer  and a persecutor  and injurious  but i obtained mercy  because i did  it  ignorantly in unbelief  
14	and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus  
15	this  is  a faithful saying  and worthy of all acceptation  that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners  of whom i am chief  
16	howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy  that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering  for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting  
17	now unto the king eternal  immortal  invisible  the only wise god   be  honour and glory for ever and ever  amen  
18 	this charge i commit unto thee  son timothy  according to the prophecies which went before on thee  that thou by them mightest war a good warfare  
19	holding faith  and a good conscience  which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck  
20	of whom is hymenaeus and alexander  whom i have delivered unto satan  that they may learn not to blaspheme  
1 timothy 2
1 	i exhort therefore  that  first of all  supplications  prayers  intercessions   and  giving of thanks  be made for all men  
2	for kings  and  for  all that are in authority  that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  
3	for this  is  good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour  
4	who will have all men to be saved  and to come unto the knowledge of the truth  
5	for  there is  one god  and one mediator between god and men  the man christ jesus  
6	who gave himself a ransom for all  to be testified in due time  
7	whereunto i am ordained a preacher  and an apostle   i speak the truth in christ   and  lie not   a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity  
8	i will therefore that men pray every where  lifting up holy hands  without wrath and doubting  
9 	in like manner also  that women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearls  or costly array  
10	but  which becometh women professing godliness  with good works  
11	let the woman learn in silence with all subjection  
12	but i suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence  
13	for adam was first formed  then eve  
14	and adam was not deceived  but the woman being deceived was in the transgression  
15	notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing  if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety  
1 timothy 3
1 	this  is  a true saying  if a man desire the office of a bishop  he desireth a good work  
2	a bishop then must be blameless  the husband of one wife  vigilant  sober  of good behaviour  given to hospitality  apt to teach  
3	not given to wine  no striker  not greedy of filthy lucre  but patient  not a brawler  not covetous  
4	one that ruleth well his own house  having his children in subjection with all gravity  
5	 for if a man know not how to rule his own house  how shall he take care of the church of god   
6	not a novice  lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil  
7	moreover he must have a good report of them which are without  lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil  
8 	likewise  must  the deacons  be  grave  not doubletongued  not given to much wine  not greedy of filthy lucre  
9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience  
10	and let these also first be proved  then let them use the office of a deacon  being  found  blameless  
11	even so  must their  wives  be  grave  not slanderers  sober  faithful in all things  
12	let the deacons be the husbands of one wife  ruling their children and their own houses well  
13	for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree  and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus  
14 	these things write i unto thee  hoping to come unto thee shortly  
15	but if i tarry long  that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god  which is the church of the living god  the pillar and ground of the truth  
16	and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness  god was manifest in the flesh  justified in the spirit  seen of angels  preached unto the gentiles  believed on in the world  received up into glory  
1 timothy 4
1 	now the spirit speaketh expressly  that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith  giving heed to seducing spirits  and doctrines of devils  
2	speaking lies in hypocrisy  having their conscience seared with a hot iron  
3	forbidding to marry   and commanding  to abstain from meats  which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth  
4	for every creature of god  is  good  and nothing to be refused  if it be received with thanksgiving  
5	for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer  
6 	if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things  thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ  nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine  whereunto thou hast attained  
7	but refuse profane and old wives  fables  and exercise thyself  rather  unto godliness  
8	for bodily exercise profiteth little  but godliness is profitable unto all things  having promise of the life that now is  and of that which is to come  
9	this  is  a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation  
10	for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach  because we trust in the living god  who is the saviour of all men  specially of those that believe  
11	these things command and teach  
12	let no man despise thy youth  but be thou an example of the believers  in word  in conversation  in charity  in spirit  in faith  in purity  
13	till i come  give attendance to reading  to exhortation  to doctrine  
14	neglect not the gift that is in thee  which was given thee by prophecy  with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery  
15	meditate upon these things  give thyself wholly to them  that thy profiting may appear to all  
16	take heed unto thyself  and unto the doctrine  continue in them  for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself  and them that hear thee  
1 timothy 5
1 	rebuke not an elder  but intreat  him  as a father   and  the younger men as brethren  
2	the elder women as mothers  the younger as sisters  with all purity  
3 	honour widows that are widows indeed  
4	but if any widow have children or nephews  let them learn first to shew piety at home  and to requite their parents  for that is good and acceptable before god  
5	now she that is a widow indeed  and desolate  trusteth in god  and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day  
6	but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth  
7	and these things give in charge  that they may be blameless  
8	but if any provide not for his own  and specially for those of his own house  he hath denied the faith  and is worse than an infidel  
9	let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old  having been the wife of one man  
10	well reported of for good works  if she have brought up children  if she have lodged strangers  if she have washed the saints  feet  if she have relieved the afflicted  if she have diligently followed every good work  
11	but the younger widows refuse  for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ  they will marry  
12	having damnation  because they have cast off their first faith  
13	and withal they learn  to be  idle  wandering about from house to house  and not only idle  but tattlers also and busybodies  speaking things which they ought not  
14	i will therefore that the younger women marry  bear children  guide the house  give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully  
15	for some are already turned aside after satan  
16	if any man or woman that believeth have widows  let them relieve them  and let not the church be charged  that it may relieve them that are widows indeed  
17 	let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour  especially they who labour in the word and doctrine  
18	for the scripture saith  thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn  and  the labourer  is  worthy of his reward  
19	against an elder receive not an accusation  but before two or three witnesses  
20	them that sin rebuke before all  that others also may fear  
21	i charge  thee  before god  and the lord jesus christ  and the elect angels  that thou observe these things without preferring one before another  doing nothing by partiality  
22	lay hands suddenly on no man  neither be partaker of other men s sins  keep thyself pure  
23	drink no longer water  but use a little wine for thy stomach s sake and thine often infirmities  
24	some men s sins are open beforehand  going before to judgment  and some  men  they follow after  
25	likewise also the good works  of some  are manifest beforehand  and they that are otherwise cannot be hid  
1 timothy 6
1 	let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour  that the name of god and  his  doctrine be not blasphemed  
2	and they that have believing masters  let them not despise  them   because they are brethren  but rather do  them  service  because they are faithful and beloved  partakers of the benefit  these things teach and exhort  
3	if any man teach otherwise  and consent not to wholesome words   even  the words of our lord jesus christ  and to the doctrine which is according to godliness  
4	he is proud  knowing nothing  but doting about questions and strifes of words  whereof cometh envy  strife  railings  evil surmisings  
5	perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds  and destitute of the truth  supposing that gain is godliness  from such withdraw thyself  
6 	but godliness with contentment is great gain  
7	for we brought nothing into  this  world   and it is  certain we can carry nothing out  
8	and having food and raiment let us be therewith content  
9	but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare  and  into  many foolish and hurtful lusts  which drown men in destruction and perdition  
10	for the love of money is the root of all evil  which while some coveted after  they have erred from the faith  and pierced themselves through with many sorrows  
11	but thou  o man of god  flee these things  and follow after righteousness  godliness  faith  love  patience  meekness  
12	fight the good fight of faith  lay hold on eternal life  whereunto thou art also called  and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses  
13 	i give thee charge in the sight of god  who quickeneth all things  and  before  christ jesus  who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession  
14	that thou keep  this  commandment without spot  unrebukeable  until the appearing of our lord jesus christ  
15	which in his times he shall shew   who is  the blessed and only potentate  the king of kings  and lord of lords  
16	who only hath immortality  dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto  whom no man hath seen  nor can see  to whom  be  honour and power everlasting  amen  
17	charge them that are rich in this world  that they be not highminded  nor trust in uncertain riches  but in the living god  who giveth us richly all things to enjoy  
18	that they do good  that they be rich in good works  ready to distribute  willing to communicate  
19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come  that they may lay hold on eternal life  
20	o timothy  keep that which is committed to thy trust  avoiding profane  and  vain babblings  and oppositions of science falsely so called  
21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith  grace  be  with thee  amen    the first to timothy was written from laodicea  which is the chiefest city of phrygia pacatiana   

2 timothy
2 timothy 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god  according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus  
2	to timothy   my  dearly beloved son  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god the father and christ jesus our lord  
3	i thank god  whom i serve from  my  forefathers with pure conscience  that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day  
4	greatly desiring to see thee  being mindful of thy tears  that i may be filled with joy  
5	when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee  which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois  and thy mother eunice  and i am persuaded that in thee also  
6 	wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god  which is in thee by the putting on of my hands  
7	for god hath not given us the spirit of fear  but of power  and of love  and of a sound mind  
8	be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord  nor of me his prisoner  but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god  
9	who hath saved us  and called  us  with an holy calling  not according to our works  but according to his own purpose and grace  which was given us in christ jesus before the world began  
10	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ  who hath abolished death  and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel  
11	whereunto i am appointed a preacher  and an apostle  and a teacher of the gentiles  
12	for the which cause i also suffer these things  nevertheless i am not ashamed  for i know whom i have believed  and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day  
13	hold fast the form of sound words  which thou hast heard of me  in faith and love which is in christ jesus  
14	that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us  
15 	this thou knowest  that all they which are in asia be turned away from me  of whom are phygellus and hermogenes  
16	the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus  for he oft refreshed me  and was not ashamed of my chain  
17	but  when he was in rome  he sought me out very diligently  and found  me   
18	the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day  and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus  thou knowest very well  
2 timothy 2
1 	thou therefore  my son  be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus  
2	and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses  the same commit thou to faithful men  who shall be able to teach others also  
3	thou therefore endure hardness  as a good soldier of jesus christ  
4	no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of  this  life  that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier  
5	and if a man also strive for masteries   yet  is he not crowned  except he strive lawfully  
6	the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits  
7	consider what i say  and the lord give thee understanding in all things  
8 	remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel  
9	wherein i suffer trouble  as an evil doer   even  unto bonds  but the word of god is not bound  
10	therefore i endure all things for the elect s sakes  that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory  
11	 it is  a faithful saying  for if we be dead with  him   we shall also live with  him   
12	if we suffer  we shall also reign with  him   if we deny  him   he also will deny us  
13	if we believe not   yet  he abideth faithful  he cannot deny himself  
14 	of these things put  them  in remembrance  charging  them  before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit   but  to the subverting of the hearers  
15	study to shew thyself approved unto god  a workman that needeth not to be ashamed  rightly dividing the word of truth  
16	but shun profane  and  vain babblings  for they will increase unto more ungodliness  
17	and their word will eat as doth a canker  of whom is hymenaeus and philetus  
18	who concerning the truth have erred  saying that the resurrection is past already  and overthrow the faith of some  
19 	nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure  having this seal  the lord knoweth them that are his  and  let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity  
20	but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver  but also of wood and of earth  and some to honour  and some to dishonour  
21	if a man therefore purge himself from these  he shall be a vessel unto honour  sanctified  and meet for the master s use   and  prepared unto every good work  
22 	flee also youthful lusts  but follow righteousness  faith  charity  peace  with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart  
23	but foolish and unlearned questions avoid  knowing that they do gender strifes  
24	and the servant of the lord must not strive  but be gentle unto all  men   apt to teach  patient  
25	in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves  if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth  
26	and  that  they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil  who are taken captive by him at his will  
2 timothy 3
1 	this know also  that in the last days perilous times shall come  
2	for men shall be lovers of their own selves  covetous  boasters  proud  blasphemers  disobedient to parents  unthankful  unholy  
3	without natural affection  trucebreakers  false accusers  incontinent  fierce  despisers of those that are good  
4	traitors  heady  highminded  lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god  
5	having a form of godliness  but denying the power thereof  from such turn away  
6	for of this sort are they which creep into houses  and lead captive silly women laden with sins  led away with divers lusts  
7	ever learning  and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth  
8	now as jannes and jambres withstood moses  so do these also resist the truth  men of corrupt minds  reprobate concerning the faith  
9	but they shall proceed no further  for their folly shall be manifest unto all  men   as theirs also was  
10 	but thou hast fully known my doctrine  manner of life  purpose  faith  longsuffering  charity  patience  
11	persecutions  afflictions  which came unto me at antioch  at iconium  at lystra  what persecutions i endured  but out of  them  all the lord delivered me  
12	yea  and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution  
13	but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse  deceiving  and being deceived  
14	but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of  knowing of whom thou hast learned  them   
15	and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures  which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus  
16	all scripture  is  given by inspiration of god  and  is  profitable for doctrine  for reproof  for correction  for instruction in righteousness  
17	that the man of god may be perfect  throughly furnished unto all good works  
2 timothy 4
1 	i charge  thee  therefore before god  and the lord jesus christ  who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom  
2	preach the word  be instant in season  out of season  reprove  rebuke  exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine  
3	for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine  but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers  having itching ears  
4	and they shall turn away  their  ears from the truth  and shall be turned unto fables  
5	but watch thou in all things  endure afflictions  do the work of an evangelist  make full proof of thy ministry  
6	for i am now ready to be offered  and the time of my departure is at hand  
7	i have fought a good fight  i have finished  my  course  i have kept the faith  
8	henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness  which the lord  the righteous judge  shall give me at that day  and not to me only  but unto all them also that love his appearing  
9 	do thy diligence to come shortly unto me  
10	for demas hath forsaken me  having loved this present world  and is departed unto thessalonica  crescens to galatia  titus unto dalmatia  
11	only luke is with me  take mark  and bring him with thee  for he is profitable to me for the ministry  
12	and tychicus have i sent to ephesus  
13	the cloke that i left at troas with carpus  when thou comest  bring  with thee   and the books   but  especially the parchments  
14	alexander the coppersmith did me much evil  the lord reward him according to his works  
15	of whom be thou ware also  for he hath greatly withstood our words  
16 	at my first answer no man stood with me  but all  men  forsook me   i pray god  that it may not be laid to their charge

titus
titus 1
1 	paul  a servant of god  and an apostle of jesus christ  according to the faith of god s elect  and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness  
2	in hope of eternal life  which god  that cannot lie  promised before the world began  
3	but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching  which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour  
4	to titus   mine  own son after the common faith  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour  
5 	for this cause left i thee in crete  that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting  and ordain elders in every city  as i had appointed thee  
6 	if any be blameless  the husband of one wife  having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly  
7	for a bishop must be blameless  as the steward of god  not selfwilled  not soon angry  not given to wine  no striker  not given to filthy lucre  
8	but a lover of hospitality  a lover of good men  sober  just  holy  temperate  
9	holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught  that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers  
10	for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers  specially they of the circumcision  
11	whose mouths must be stopped  who subvert whole houses  teaching things which they ought not  for filthy lucre s sake  
12	one of themselves   even  a prophet of their own  said  the cretians  are  alway liars  evil beasts  slow bellies  
13	this witness is true  wherefore rebuke them sharply  that they may be sound in the faith  
14	not giving heed to jewish fables  and commandments of men  that turn from the truth  
15	unto the pure all things  are  pure  but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving  is  nothing pure  but even their mind and conscience is defiled  
16	they profess that they know god  but in works they deny  him   being abominable  and disobedient  and unto every good work reprobate  
titus 2
1 	but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  
2	that the aged men be sober  grave  temperate  sound in faith  in charity  in patience  
3	the aged women likewise  that  they be  in behaviour as becometh holiness  not false accusers  not given to much wine  teachers of good things  
4	that they may teach the young women to be sober  to love their husbands  to love their children  
5	 to be  discreet  chaste  keepers at home  good  obedient to their own husbands  that the word of god be not blasphemed  
6	young men likewise exhort to be sober minded  
7	in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works  in doctrine  shewing  uncorruptness  gravity  sincerity  
8	sound speech  that cannot be condemned  that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed  having no evil thing to say of you  
9	 exhort  servants to be obedient unto their own masters   and  to please  them  well in all  things   not answering again  
10	not purloining  but shewing all good fidelity  that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things  
11 	for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men  
12	teaching us that  denying ungodliness and worldly lusts  we should live soberly  righteously  and godly  in this present world  
13	looking for that blessed hope  and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ  
14	who gave himself for us  that he might redeem us from all iniquity  and purify unto himself a peculiar people  zealous of good works  
15 	these things speak  and exhort  and rebuke with all authority  let no man despise thee  
titus 3
1 	put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers  to obey magistrates  to be ready to every good work  
2	to speak evil of no man  to be no brawlers   but  gentle  shewing all meekness unto all men  
3	for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish  disobedient  deceived  serving divers lusts and pleasures  living in malice and envy  hateful   and  hating one another  
4	but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared  
5	not by works of righteousness which we have done  but according to his mercy he saved us  by the washing of regeneration  and renewing of the holy ghost  
6	which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour  
7	that being justified by his grace  we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life  
8	 this is  a faithful saying  and these things i will that thou affirm constantly  that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works  these things are good and profitable unto men  
9 	but avoid foolish questions  and genealogies  and contentions  and strivings about the law  for they are unprofitable and vain  
10	a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject  
11	knowing that he that is such is subverted  and sinneth  being condemned of himself  
12	when i shall send artemas unto thee  or tychicus  be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis  for i have determined there to winter  
13	bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently  that nothing be wanting unto them  
14	and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses  that they be not unfruitful  
15	all that are with me salute thee  greet them that love us in the faith  grace  be  with you all  amen    it was written to titus  ordained the first bishop of the church of the cretians  from nicopolis of macedonia

1 	paul  a prisoner of jesus christ  and timothy  our  brother  unto philemon our dearly beloved  and fellowlabourer  
2	and to  our  beloved apphia  and archippus our fellowsoldier  and to the church in thy house  
3	grace to you  and peace  from god our father and the lord jesus christ  
4	i thank my god  making mention of thee always in my prayers  
5	hearing of thy love and faith  which thou hast toward the lord jesus  and toward all saints  
6	that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus  
7	for we have great joy and consolation in thy love  because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee  brother  
8 	wherefore  though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient  
9	yet for love s sake i rather beseech  thee   being such an one as paul the aged  and now also a prisoner of jesus christ  
10	i beseech thee for my son onesimus  whom i have begotten in my bonds  
11	which in time past was to thee unprofitable  but now profitable to thee and to me  
12	whom i have sent again  thou therefore receive him  that is  mine own bowels  
13	whom i would have retained with me  that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel  
14	but without thy mind would i do nothing  that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity  but willingly  
15	for perhaps he therefore departed for a season  that thou shouldest receive him for ever  
16	not now as a servant  but above a servant  a brother beloved  specially to me  but how much more unto thee  both in the flesh  and in the lord  
17	if thou count me therefore a partner  receive him as myself  
18	if he hath wronged thee  or oweth  thee  ought  put that on mine account  
19	i paul have written  it  with mine own hand  i will repay  it   albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides  
20	yea  brother  let me have joy of thee in the lord  refresh my bowels in the lord  
21	having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee  knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say

hebrews
hebrews 1
1 	god  who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets  
2	hath in these last days spoken unto us by  his  son  whom he hath appointed heir of all things  by whom also he made the worlds  
3	who being the brightness of  his  glory  and the express image of his person  and upholding all things by the word of his power  when he had by himself purged our sins  sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high  
4 	being made so much better than the angels  as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they  
5	for unto which of the angels said he at any time  thou art my son  this day have i begotten thee  and again  i will be to him a father  and he shall be to me a son  
6	and again  when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world  he saith  and let all the angels of god worship him  
7	and of the angels he saith  who maketh his angels spirits  and his ministers a flame of fire  
8	but unto the son  he saith   thy throne  o god   is  for ever and ever  a sceptre of righteousness  is  the sceptre of thy kingdom  
9	thou hast loved righteousness  and hated iniquity  therefore god   even  thy god  hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  
10	and  thou  lord  in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth  and the heavens are the works of thine hands  
11	they shall perish  but thou remainest  and they all shall wax old as doth a garment  
12	and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up  and they shall be changed  but thou art the same  and thy years shall not fail  
13	but to which of the angels said he at any time  sit on my right hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool  
14	are they not all ministering spirits  sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation  
hebrews 2
1 	therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard  lest at any time we should let  them  slip  
2	for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast  and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward  
3	how shall we escape  if we neglect so great salvation  which at the first began to be spoken by the lord  and was confirmed unto us by them that heard  him   
4	god also bearing  them  witness  both with signs and wonders  and with divers miracles  and gifts of the holy ghost  according to his own will  
5 	for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come  whereof we speak  
6	but one in a certain place testified  saying  what is man  that thou art mindful of him  or the son of man  that thou visitest him  
7	thou madest him a little lower than the angels  thou crownedst him with glory and honour  and didst set him over the works of thy hands  
8	thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet  for in that he put all in subjection under him  he left nothing  that is  not put under him  but now we see not yet all things put under him  
9	but we see jesus  who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death  crowned with glory and honour  that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man  
10 	for it became him  for whom  are  all things  and by whom  are  all things  in bringing many sons unto glory  to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings  
11	for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified  are  all of one  for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren  
12	saying  i will declare thy name unto my brethren  in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee  
13	and again  i will put my trust in him  and again  behold i and the children which god hath given me  
14 	forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood  he also himself likewise took part of the same  that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death  that is  the devil  
15	and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage  
16	for verily he took not on  him the nature of  angels  but he took on  him  the seed of abraham  
17	wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto  his  brethren  that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things  pertaining  to god  to make reconciliation for the sins of the people  
18	for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted  he is able to succour them that are tempted  
hebrews 3
1 	wherefore  holy brethren  partakers of the heavenly calling  consider the apostle and high priest of our profession  christ jesus  
2	who was faithful to him that appointed him  as also moses  was faithful  in all his house  
3	for this  man  was counted worthy of more glory than moses  inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house  
4	for every house is builded by some  man   but he that built all things  is  god  
5	and moses verily  was  faithful in all his house  as a servant  for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after  
6	but christ as a son over his own house  whose house are we  if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end  
7 	wherefore  as the holy ghost saith  to day if ye will hear his voice  
8	harden not your hearts  as in the provocation  in the day of temptation in the wilderness  
9	when your fathers tempted me  proved me  and saw my works forty years  
10	wherefore i was grieved with that generation  and said  they do alway err in  their  heart  and they have not known my ways  
11	so i sware in my wrath  they shall not enter into my rest   
12	take heed  brethren  lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief  in departing from the living god  
13	but exhort one another daily  while it is called to day  lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin  
14	for we are made partakers of christ  if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end  
15	while it is said  to day if ye will hear his voice  harden not your hearts  as in the provocation  
16	for some  when they had heard  did provoke  howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses  
17	but with whom was he grieved forty years   was it  not with them that had sinned  whose carcases fell in the wilderness  
18	and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest  but to them that believed not  
19	so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief  
hebrews 4
1 	let us therefore fear  lest  a promise being left  us  of entering into his rest  any of you should seem to come short of it  
2	for unto us was the gospel preached  as well as unto them  but the word preached did not profit them  not being mixed with faith in them that heard  it   
3	for we which have believed do enter into rest  as he said  as i have sworn in my wrath  if they shall enter into my rest  although the works were finished from the foundation of the world  
4	for he spake in a certain place of the seventh  day  on this wise  and god did rest the seventh day from all his works  
5	and in this  place  again  if they shall enter into my rest  
6	seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein  and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief  
7	again  he limiteth a certain day  saying in david  to day  after so long a time  as it is said  to day if ye will hear his voice  harden not your hearts  
8	for if jesus had given them rest  then would he not afterward have spoken of another day  
9	there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god  
10	for he that is entered into his rest  he also hath ceased from his own works  as god  did  from his  
11 	let us labour therefore to enter into that rest  lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief  
12	for the word of god  is  quick  and powerful  and sharper than any twoedged sword  piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit  and of the joints and marrow  and  is  a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart  
13	neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight  but all things  are  naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do  
14	seeing then that we have a great high priest  that is passed into the heavens  jesus the son of god  let us hold fast  our  profession  
15	for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities  but was in all points tempted like as  we are  yet  without sin  
16	let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace  that we may obtain mercy  and find grace to help in time of need  
hebrews 5
1 	for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things  pertaining  to god  that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins  
2	who can have compassion on the ignorant  and on them that are out of the way  for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity  
3	and by reason hereof he ought  as for the people  so also for himself  to offer for sins  
4	and no man taketh this honour unto himself  but he that is called of god  as  was  aaron  
5	so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest  but he that said unto him  thou art my son  to day have i begotten thee  
6	as he saith also in another  place   thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
7	who in the days of his flesh  when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death  and was heard in that he feared  
8	though he were a son  yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered  
9	and being made perfect  he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him  
10 	called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec  
11	of whom we have many things to say  and hard to be uttered  seeing ye are dull of hearing  
12	for when for the time ye ought to be teachers  ye have need that one teach you again which  be  the first principles of the oracles of god  and are become such as have need of milk  and not of strong meat  
13	for every one that useth milk  is  unskilful in the word of righteousness  for he is a babe  
14	but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age   even  those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil  
hebrews 6
1 	therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ  let us go on unto perfection  not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works  and of faith toward god  
2	of the doctrine of baptisms  and of laying on of hands  and of resurrection of the dead  and of eternal judgment  
3	and this will we do  if god permit  
4	for  it is  impossible for those who were once enlightened  and have tasted of the heavenly gift  and were made partakers of the holy ghost  
5	and have tasted the good word of god  and the powers of the world to come  
6	if they shall fall away  to renew them again unto repentance  seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh  and put  him  to an open shame  
7	for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it  and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed  receiveth blessing from god  
8	but that which beareth thorns and briers  is  rejected  and  is  nigh unto cursing  whose end  is  to be burned  
9 	but  beloved  we are persuaded better things of you  and things that accompany salvation  though we thus speak  
10	for god  is  not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love  which ye have shewed toward his name  in that ye have ministered to the saints  and do minister  
11	and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end  
12	that ye be not slothful  but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises  
13	for when god made promise to abraham  because he could swear by no greater  he sware by himself  
14	saying  surely blessing i will bless thee  and multiplying i will multiply thee  
15	and so  after he had patiently endured  he obtained the promise  
16	for men verily swear by the greater  and an oath for confirmation  is  to them an end of all strife  
17	wherein god  willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel  confirmed  it  by an oath  
18	that by two immutable things  in which  it was  impossible for god to lie  we might have a strong consolation  who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us  
19	which  hope  we have as an anchor of the soul  both sure and stedfast  and which entereth into that within the veil  
20	whither the forerunner is for us entered   even  jesus  made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
hebrews 7
1 	for this melchisedec  king of salem  priest of the most high god  who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings  and blessed him  
2	to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all  first being by interpretation king of righteousness  and after that also king of salem  which is  king of peace  
3	without father  without mother  without descent  having neither beginning of days  nor end of life  but made like unto the son of god  abideth a priest continually  
4	now consider how great this man  was   unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils  
5	and verily they that are of the sons of levi  who receive the office of the priesthood  have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law  that is  of their brethren  though they come out of the loins of abraham  
6	but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham  and blessed him that had the promises  
7	and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better  
8	and here men that die receive tithes  but there he  receiveth them   of whom it is witnessed that he liveth  
9	and as i may so say  levi also  who receiveth tithes  payed tithes in abraham  
10	for he was yet in the loins of his father  when melchisedec met him  
11 	if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood   for under it the people received the law   what further need  was there  that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec  and not be called after the order of aaron  
12	for the priesthood being changed  there is made of necessity a change also of the law  
13	for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe  of which no man gave attendance at the altar  
14	for  it is  evident that our lord sprang out of juda  of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood  
15	and it is yet far more evident  for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest  
16	who is made  not after the law of a carnal commandment  but after the power of an endless life  
17	for he testifieth  thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
18	for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof  
19	for the law made nothing perfect  but the bringing in of a better hope  did   by the which we draw nigh unto god  
20	and inasmuch as not without an oath  he was made priest   
21	 for those priests were made without an oath  but this with an oath by him that said unto him  the lord sware and will not repent  thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec   
22	by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament  
23	and they truly were many priests  because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death  
24	but this  man   because he continueth ever  hath an unchangeable priesthood  
25	wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him  seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them  
26	for such an high priest became us   who is  holy  harmless  undefiled  separate from sinners  and made higher than the heavens  
27	who needeth not daily  as those high priests  to offer up sacrifice  first for his own sins  and then for the people s  for this he did once  when he offered up himself  
28	for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity  but the word of the oath  which was since the law   maketh  the son  who is consecrated for evermore  
hebrews 8
1 	now of the things which we have spoken  this is  the sum  we have such an high priest  who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens  
2	a minister of the sanctuary  and of the true tabernacle  which the lord pitched  and not man  
3	for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices  wherefore  it is  of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer  
4	for if he were on earth  he should not be a priest  seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law  
5	who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things  as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle  for  see  saith he   that  thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount  
6 	but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry  by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant  which was established upon better promises  
7	for if that first  covenant  had been faultless  then should no place have been sought for the second  
8	for finding fault with them  he saith  behold  the days come  saith the lord  when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah  
9	not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt  because they continued not in my covenant  and i regarded them not  saith the lord  
10	for this  is  the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days  saith the lord  i will put my laws into their mind  and write them in their hearts  and i will be to them a god  and they shall be to me a people  
11	and they shall not teach every man his neighbour  and every man his brother  saying  know the lord  for all shall know me  from the least to the greatest  
12	for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness  and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more  
13	in that he saith  a new  covenant   he hath made the first old  now that which decayeth and waxeth old  is  ready to vanish away  
hebrews 9
1 	then verily the first  covenant  had also ordinances of divine service  and a worldly sanctuary  
2	for there was a tabernacle made  the first  wherein  was  the candlestick  and the table  and the shewbread  which is called the sanctuary  
3	and after the second veil  the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all  
4	which had the golden censer  and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold  wherein  was  the golden pot that had manna  and aaron s rod that budded  and the tables of the covenant  
5	and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat  of which we cannot now speak particularly  
6	now when these things were thus ordained  the priests went always into the first tabernacle  accomplishing the service  of god   
7	but into the second  went  the high priest alone once every year  not without blood  which he offered for himself  and  for  the errors of the people  
8 	the holy ghost this signifying  that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest  while as the first tabernacle was yet standing  
9	which  was  a figure for the time then present  in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices  that could not make him that did the service perfect  as pertaining to the conscience  
10	 which stood  only in meats and drinks  and divers washings  and carnal ordinances  imposed  on them  until the time of reformation  
11	but christ being come an high priest of good things to come  by a greater and more perfect tabernacle  not made with hands  that is to say  not of this building  
12	neither by the blood of goats and calves  but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place  having obtained eternal redemption  for us   
13	for if the blood of bulls and of goats  and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean  sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh  
14	how much more shall the blood of christ  who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god  purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god  
15 	and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament  that by means of death  for the redemption of the transgressions  that were  under the first testament  they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance  
16	for where a testament  is   there must also of necessity be the death of the testator  
17	for a testament  is  of force after men are dead  otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth  
18	whereupon neither the first  testament  was dedicated without blood  
19	for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law  he took the blood of calves and of goats  with water  and scarlet wool  and hyssop  and sprinkled both the book  and all the people  
20	saying  this  is  the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you  
21	moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle  and all the vessels of the ministry  
22	and almost all things are by the law purged with blood  and without shedding of blood is no remission  
23 	 it was  therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these  but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these  
24	for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands   which are  the figures of the true  but into heaven itself  now to appear in the presence of god for us  
25	nor yet that he should offer himself often  as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others  
26	for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world  but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself  
27	and as it is appointed unto men once to die  but after this the judgment  
28	so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many  and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation  
hebrews 10
1 	for the law having a shadow of good things to come   and  not the very image of the things  can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect  
2	for then would they not have ceased to be offered  because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins  
3	but in those  sacrifices there is  a remembrance again  made  of sins every year  
4	for  it is  not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins  
5	wherefore when he cometh into the world  he saith  sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not  but a body hast thou prepared me  
6	in burnt offerings and  sacrifices  for sin thou hast had no pleasure  
7 	then said i  lo  i come  in the volume of the book it is written of me   to do thy will  o god  
8	above when he said  sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and  offering  for sin thou wouldest not  neither hadst pleasure  therein   which are offered by the law  
9	then said he  lo  i come to do thy will  o god  he taketh away the first  that he may establish the second  
10	by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once  for all   
11	and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices  which can never take away sins  
12	but this man  after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever  sat down on the right hand of god  
13	from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool  
14	for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified  
15	 whereof  the holy ghost also is a witness to us  for after that he had said before  
16	this  is  the covenant that i will make with them after those days  saith the lord  i will put my laws into their hearts  and in their minds will i write them  
17	and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more  
18	now where remission of these  is  there is  no more offering for sin  
19 	having therefore  brethren  boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus  
20	by a new and living way  which he hath consecrated for us  through the veil  that is to say  his flesh  
21	and  having  an high priest over the house of god  
22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith  having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience  and our bodies washed with pure water  
23	let us hold fast the profession of  our  faith without wavering   for he  is  faithful that promised   
24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works  
25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together  as the manner of some  is   but exhorting  one another   and so much the more  as ye see the day approaching  
26	for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth  there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins  
27	but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation  which shall devour the adversaries  
28	he that despised moses  law died without mercy under two or three witnesses  
29	of how much sorer punishment  suppose ye  shall he be thought worthy  who hath trodden under foot the son of god  and hath counted the blood of the covenant  wherewith he was sanctified  an unholy thing  and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace  
30	for we know him that hath said  vengeance  belongeth  unto me  i will recompense  saith the lord  and again  the lord shall judge his people  
31	 it is  a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  
32	but call to remembrance the former days  in which  after ye were illuminated  ye endured a great fight of afflictions  
33	partly  whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions  and partly  whilst ye became companions of them that were so used  
34	for ye had compassion of me in my bonds  and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods  knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance  
35	cast not away therefore your confidence  which hath great recompence of reward  
36	for ye have need of patience  that  after ye have done the will of god  ye might receive the promise  
37	for yet a little while  and he that shall come will come  and will not tarry  
38	now the just shall live by faith  but if  any man  draw back  my soul shall have no pleasure in him  
39	but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition  but of them that believe to the saving of the soul  
hebrews 11
1 	now faith is the substance of things hoped for  the evidence of things not seen  
2	for by it the elders obtained a good report  
3	through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god  so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear  
4 	by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain  by which he obtained witness that he was righteous  god testifying of his gifts  and by it he being dead yet speaketh  
5	by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death  and was not found  because god had translated him  for before his translation he had this testimony  that he pleased god  
6	but without faith  it is  impossible to please  him   for he that cometh to god must believe that he is  and  that  he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him  
7	by faith noah  being warned of god of things not seen as yet  moved with fear  prepared an ark to the saving of his house  by the which he condemned the world  and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith  
8	by faith abraham  when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance  obeyed  and he went out  not knowing whither he went  
9	by faith he sojourned in the land of promise  as  in  a strange country  dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob  the heirs with him of the same promise  
10	for he looked for a city which hath foundations  whose builder and maker  is  god  
11	through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed  and was delivered of a child when she was past age  because she judged him faithful who had promised  
12	therefore sprang there even of one  and him as good as dead   so many  as the stars of the sky in multitude  and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable  
13	these all died in faith  not having received the promises  but having seen them afar off  and were persuaded of  them   and embraced  them   and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth  
14	for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country  
15	and truly  if they had been mindful of that  country  from whence they came out  they might have had opportunity to have returned  
16	but now they desire a better  country   that is  an heavenly  wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god  for he hath prepared for them a city  
17	by faith abraham  when he was tried  offered up isaac  and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten  son   
18	of whom it was said  that in isaac shall thy seed be called  
19	accounting that god  was  able to raise  him  up  even from the dead  from whence also he received him in a figure  
20	by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come  
21	by faith jacob  when he was a dying  blessed both the sons of joseph  and worshipped   leaning  upon the top of his staff  
22	by faith joseph  when he died  made mention of the departing of the children of israel  and gave commandment concerning his bones  
23	by faith moses  when he was born  was hid three months of his parents  because they saw  he was  a proper child  and they were not afraid of the king s commandment  
24	by faith moses  when he was come to years  refused to be called the son of pharaoh s daughter  
25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god  than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season  
26	esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt  for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward  
27	by faith he forsook egypt  not fearing the wrath of the king  for he endured  as seeing him who is invisible  
28	through faith he kept the passover  and the sprinkling of blood  lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them  
29	by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry  land   which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned  
30	by faith the walls of jericho fell down  after they were compassed about seven days  
31	by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not  when she had received the spies with peace  
32 	and what shall i more say  for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon  and  of  barak  and  of  samson  and  of  jephthae   of  david also  and samuel  and  of  the prophets  
33	who through faith subdued kingdoms  wrought righteousness  obtained promises  stopped the mouths of lions  
34	quenched the violence of fire  escaped the edge of the sword  out of weakness were made strong  waxed valiant in fight  turned to flight the armies of the aliens  
35	women received their dead raised to life again  and others were tortured  not accepting deliverance  that they might obtain a better resurrection  
36	and others had trial of  cruel  mockings and scourgings  yea  moreover of bonds and imprisonment  
37	they were stoned  they were sawn asunder  were tempted  were slain with the sword  they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins  being destitute  afflicted  tormented  
38	 of whom the world was not worthy   they wandered in deserts  and  in  mountains  and  in  dens and caves of the earth  
39	and these all  having obtained a good report through faith  received not the promise  
40	god having provided some better thing for us  that they without us should not be made perfect  
hebrews 12
1 	wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses  let us lay aside every weight  and the sin which doth so easily beset  us   and let us run with patience the race that is set before us  
2	looking unto jesus the author and finisher of  our  faith  who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross  despising the shame  and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god  
3	for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself  lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds  
4 	ye have not yet resisted unto blood  striving against sin  
5	and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children  my son  despise not thou the chastening of the lord  nor faint when thou art rebuked of him  
6	for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth  and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  
7	if ye endure chastening  god dealeth with you as with sons  for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not  
8	but if ye be without chastisement  whereof all are partakers  then are ye bastards  and not sons  
9	furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected  us   and we gave  them  reverence  shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits  and live  
10	for they verily for a few days chastened  us  after their own pleasure  but he for  our  profit  that  we  might be partakers of his holiness  
11	now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous  but grievous  nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby  
12	wherefore lift up the hands which hang down  and the feeble knees  
13	and make straight paths for your feet  lest that which is lame be turned out of the way  but let it rather be healed  
14	follow peace with all  men   and holiness  without which no man shall see the lord  
15	looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god  lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  you   and thereby many be defiled  
16	lest there  be  any fornicator  or profane person  as esau  who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright  
17	for ye know how that afterward  when he would have inherited the blessing  he was rejected  for he found no place of repentance  though he sought it carefully with tears  
18 	for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched  and that burned with fire  nor unto blackness  and darkness  and tempest  
19	and the sound of a trumpet  and the voice of words  which  voice  they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more  
20	 for they could not endure that which was commanded  and if so much as a beast touch the mountain  it shall be stoned  or thrust through with a dart  
21	and so terrible was the sight   that  moses said  i exceedingly fear and quake   
22	but ye are come unto mount sion  and unto the city of the living god  the heavenly jerusalem  and to an innumerable company of angels  
23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn  which are written in heaven  and to god the judge of all  and to the spirits of just men made perfect  
24	and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant  and to the blood of sprinkling  that speaketh better things than  that of  abel  
25	see that ye refuse not him that speaketh  for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth  much more  shall not  we  escape   if we turn away from him that  speaketh  from heaven  
26	whose voice then shook the earth  but now he hath promised  saying  yet once more i shake not the earth only  but also heaven  
27	and this  word   yet once more  signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken  as of things that are made  that those things which cannot be shaken may remain  
28	wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved  let us have grace  whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear  
29	for our god  is  a consuming fire  
hebrews 13
1 	let brotherly love continue  
2	be not forgetful to entertain strangers  for thereby some have entertained angels unawares  
3	remember them that are in bonds  as bound with them   and  them which suffer adversity  as being yourselves also in the body  
4	marriage  is  honourable in all  and the bed undefiled  but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge  
5	 let your  conversation  be  without covetousness   and be  content with such things as ye have  for he hath said  i will never leave thee  nor forsake thee  
6	so that we may boldly say  the lord  is  my helper  and i will not fear what man shall do unto me  
7	remember them which have the rule over you  who have spoken unto you the word of god  whose faith follow  considering the end of  their  conversation  
8	jesus christ the same yesterday  and to day  and for ever  
9	be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines  for  it is  a good thing that the heart be established with grace  not with meats  which have not profited them that have been occupied therein  
10	we have an altar  whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle  
11	for the bodies of those beasts  whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin  are burned without the camp  
12	wherefore jesus also  that he might sanctify the people with his own blood  suffered without the gate  
13	let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp  bearing his reproach  
14	for here have we no continuing city  but we seek one to come  
15	by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually  that is  the fruit of  our  lips giving thanks to his name  
16	but to do good and to communicate forget not  for with such sacrifices god is well pleased  
17	obey them that have the rule over you  and submit yourselves  for they watch for your souls  as they that must give account  that they may do it with joy  and not with grief  for that  is  unprofitable for you  
18 	pray for us  for we trust we have a good conscience  in all things willing to live honestly  
19	but i beseech  you  the rather to do this  that i may be restored to you the sooner  
20	now the god of peace  that brought again from the dead our lord jesus  that great shepherd of the sheep  through the blood of the everlasting covenant  
21	make you perfect in every good work to do his will  working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight  through jesus christ  to whom  be  glory for ever and ever  amen  
22	and i beseech you  brethren  suffer the word of exhortation  for i have written a letter unto you in few words  
23	know ye that  our  brother timothy is set at liberty  with whom  if he come shortly  i will see you  
24	salute all them that have the rule over you  and all the saints  they of italy salute you  
25	grace  be  with you all  amen    written to the hebrews from italy  by timothy

james 1
1 	james  a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ  to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  greeting  
2 	my brethren  count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations  
3	knowing  this   that the trying of your faith worketh patience  
4	but let patience have  her  perfect work  that ye may be perfect and entire  wanting nothing  
5	if any of you lack wisdom  let him ask of god  that giveth to all  men  liberally  and upbraideth not  and it shall be given him  
6	but let him ask in faith  nothing wavering  for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed  
7	for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord  
8	a double minded man  is  unstable in all his ways  
9	let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted  
10	but the rich  in that he is made low  because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away  
11	for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat  but it withereth the grass  and the flower thereof falleth  and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth  so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways  
12	blessed  is  the man that endureth temptation  for when he is tried  he shall receive the crown of life  which the lord hath promised to them that love him  
13 	let no man say when he is tempted  i am tempted of god  for god cannot be tempted with evil  neither tempteth he any man  
14	but every man is tempted  when he is drawn away of his own lust  and enticed  
15	then when lust hath conceived  it bringeth forth sin  and sin  when it is finished  bringeth forth death  
16	do not err  my beloved brethren  
17	every good gift and every perfect gift is from above  and cometh down from the father of lights  with whom is no variableness  neither shadow of turning  
18	of his own will begat he us with the word of truth  that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures  
19 	wherefore  my beloved brethren  let every man be swift to hear  slow to speak  slow to wrath  
20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god  
21	wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness  and receive with meekness the engrafted word  which is able to save your souls  
22	but be ye doers of the word  and not hearers only  deceiving your own selves  
23	for if any be a hearer of the word  and not a doer  he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass  
24	for he beholdeth himself  and goeth his way  and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was  
25	but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty  and continueth  therein   he being not a forgetful hearer  but a doer of the work  this man shall be blessed in his deed  
26	if any man among you seem to be religious  and bridleth not his tongue  but deceiveth his own heart  this man s religion  is  vain  
27	pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this  to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction   and  to keep himself unspotted from the world  
james 2
1 	my brethren  have not the faith of our lord jesus christ   the lord  of glory  with respect of persons  
2	for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring  in goodly apparel  and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment  
3	and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing  and say unto him  sit thou here in a good place  and say to the poor  stand thou there  or sit here under my footstool  
4	are ye not then partial in yourselves  and are become judges of evil thoughts  
5	hearken  my beloved brethren  hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith  and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him  
6	but ye have despised the poor  do not rich men oppress you  and draw you before the judgment seats  
7	do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called  
8 	if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  ye do well  
9	but if ye have respect to persons  ye commit sin  and are convinced of the law as transgressors  
10	for whosoever shall keep the whole law  and yet offend in one  point   he is guilty of all  
11	for he that said  do not commit adultery  said also  do not kill  now if thou commit no adultery  yet if thou kill  thou art become a transgressor of the law  
12	so speak ye  and so do  as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty  
13	for he shall have judgment without mercy  that hath shewed no mercy  and mercy rejoiceth against judgment  
14 	what  doth it  profit  my brethren  though a man say he hath faith  and have not works  can faith save him  
15	if a brother or sister be naked  and destitute of daily food  
16	and one of you say unto them  depart in peace  be  ye  warmed and filled  notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body  what  doth it  profit  
17	even so faith  if it hath not works  is dead  being alone  
18	yea  a man may say  thou hast faith  and i have works  shew me thy faith without thy works  and i will shew thee my faith by my works  
19	thou believest that there is one god  thou doest well  the devils also believe  and tremble  
20	but wilt thou know  o vain man  that faith without works is dead  
21	was not abraham our father justified by works  when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar  
22	seest thou how faith wrought with his works  and by works was faith made perfect  
23	and the scripture was fulfilled which saith  abraham believed god  and it was imputed unto him for righteousness  and he was called the friend of god  
24	ye see then how that by works a man is justified  and not by faith only  
25	likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works  when she had received the messengers  and had sent  them  out another way  
26	for as the body without the spirit is dead  so faith without works is dead also  
james 3
1 	my brethren  be not many masters  knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation  
2	for in many things we offend all  if any man offend not in word  the same  is  a perfect man   and  able also to bridle the whole body  
3	behold  we put bits in the horses  mouths  that they may obey us  and we turn about their whole body  
4	behold also the ships  which though  they be  so great  and  are  driven of fierce winds  yet are they turned about with a very small helm  whithersoever the governor listeth  
5	even so the tongue is a little member  and boasteth great things  behold  how great a matter a little fire kindleth  
6	and the tongue  is  a fire  a world of iniquity  so is the tongue among our members  that it defileth the whole body  and setteth on fire the course of nature  and it is set on fire of hell  
7	for every kind of beasts  and of birds  and of serpents  and of things in the sea  is tamed  and hath been tamed of mankind  
8	but the tongue can no man tame   it is  an unruly evil  full of deadly poison  
9	therewith bless we god  even the father  and therewith curse we men  which are made after the similitude of god  
10	out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing  my brethren  these things ought not so to be  
11	doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet  water  and bitter  
12	can the fig tree  my brethren  bear olive berries  either a vine  figs  so  can  no fountain both yield salt water and fresh  
13 	who  is  a wise man and endued with knowledge among you  let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom  
14	but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts  glory not  and lie not against the truth  
15	this wisdom descendeth not from above  but  is  earthly  sensual  devilish  
16	for where envying and strife  is   there  is  confusion and every evil work  
17	but the wisdom that is from above is first pure  then peaceable  gentle   and  easy to be intreated  full of mercy and good fruits  without partiality  and without hypocrisy  
18	and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace  
james 4
1 	from whence  come  wars and fightings among you   come they  not hence   even  of your lusts that war in your members  
2	ye lust  and have not  ye kill  and desire to have  and cannot obtain  ye fight and war  yet ye have not  because ye ask not  
3	ye ask  and receive not  because ye ask amiss  that ye may consume  it  upon your lusts  
4	ye adulterers and adulteresses  know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god  whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god  
5	do ye think that the scripture saith in vain  the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy  
6	but he giveth more grace  wherefore he saith  god resisteth the proud  but giveth grace unto the humble  
7	submit yourselves therefore to god  resist the devil  and he will flee from you  
8	draw nigh to god  and he will draw nigh to you  cleanse  your  hands   ye  sinners  and purify  your  hearts   ye  double minded  
9	be afflicted  and mourn  and weep  let your laughter be turned to mourning  and  your  joy to heaviness  
10	humble yourselves in the sight of the lord  and he shall lift you up  
11 	speak not evil one of another  brethren  he that speaketh evil of  his  brother  and judgeth his brother  speaketh evil of the law  and judgeth the law  but if thou judge the law  thou art not a doer of the law  but a judge  
12	there is one lawgiver  who is able to save and to destroy  who art thou that judgest another  
13	go to now  ye that say  to day or to morrow we will go into such a city  and continue there a year  and buy and sell  and get gain  
14	whereas ye know not what  shall be  on the morrow  for what  is  your life  it is even a vapour  that appeareth for a little time  and then vanisheth away  
15	for that ye  ought  to say  if the lord will  we shall live  and do this  or that  
16	but now ye rejoice in your boastings  all such rejoicing is evil  
17	therefore to him that knoweth to do good  and doeth  it  not  to him it is sin

4	behold  the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields  which is of you kept back by fraud  crieth  and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth  
5	ye have lived in pleasure on the earth  and been wanton  ye have nourished your hearts  as in a day of slaughter  
6	ye have condemned  and  killed the just   and  he doth not resist you  
7	be patient therefore  brethren  unto the coming of the lord  behold  the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth  and hath long patience for it  until he receive the early and latter rain  
8	be ye also patient  stablish your hearts  for the coming of the lord draweth nigh  
9	grudge not one against another  brethren  lest ye be condemned  behold  the judge standeth before the door  
10	take  my brethren  the prophets  who have spoken in the name of the lord  for an example of suffering affliction  and of patience  
11	behold  we count them happy which endure  ye have heard of the patience of job  and have seen the end of the lord  that the lord is very pitiful  and of tender mercy  
12 	but above all things  my brethren  swear not  neither by heaven  neither by the earth  neither by any other oath  but let your yea be yea  and  your  nay  nay  lest ye fall into condemnation

16	confess  your  faults one to another  and pray one for another  that ye may be healed  the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much  
17	elias was a man subject to like passions as we are  and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain  and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months  
18	and he prayed again  and the heaven gave rain  and the earth brought forth her fruit  
19	brethren  if any of you do err from the truth  and one convert him  
20	let him know  that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death  and shall hide a multitude of sins
