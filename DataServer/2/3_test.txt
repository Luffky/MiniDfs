21	then i testified against them  and said unto them  why lodge ye about the wall  if ye do  so  again  i will lay hands on you  from that time forth came they no  more  on the sabbath  
22	and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves  and  that  they should come  and  keep the gates  to sanctify the sabbath day  remember me  o my god   concerning  this also  and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy  
23 	in those days also saw i jews  that  had married wives of ashdod  of ammon   and  of moab  
24	and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod  and could not speak in the jews  language  but according to the language of each people

1 	now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus   this  is  ahasuerus which reigned  from india even unto ethiopia   over  an hundred and seven and twenty provinces   
2	 that  in those days  when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom  which  was  in shushan the palace  
3	in the third year of his reign  he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants  the power of persia and media  the nobles and princes of the provinces   being  before him  
4	when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days   even  an hundred and fourscore days  
5	and when these days were expired  the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace  both unto great and small  seven days  in the court of the garden of the king s palace  
6	 where were  white  green  and blue   hangings   fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble  the beds  were of  gold and silver  upon a pavement of red  and blue  and white  and black  marble  
7	and they gave  them  drink in vessels of gold   the vessels being diverse one from another   and royal wine in abundance  according to the state of the king  
8	and the drinking  was  according to the law  none did compel  for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house  that they should do according to every man s pleasure  
9	also vashti the queen made a feast for the women  in  the royal house which  belonged  to king ahasuerus  
10 	on the seventh day  when the heart of the king was merry with wine  he commanded mehuman  biztha  harbona  bigtha  and abagtha  zethar  and carcas  the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king  
11	to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal  to shew the people and the princes her beauty  for she  was  fair to look on  
12	but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment by  his  chamberlains  therefore was the king very wroth  and his anger burned in him  
13	then the king said to the wise men  which knew the times   for so  was  the king s manner toward all that knew law and judgment  
14	and the next unto him  was  carshena  shethar  admatha  tarshish  meres  marsena   and  memucan  the seven princes of persia and media  which saw the king s face   and  which sat the first in the kingdom   
15	what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law  because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains  
16	and memucan answered before the king and the princes  vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only  but also to all the princes  and to all the people that  are  in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus  
17	for  this  deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women  so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes  when it shall be reported  the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him  but she came not  
18	 likewise  shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king s princes  which have heard of the deed of the queen  thus  shall there arise  too much contempt and wrath  
19	if it please the king  let there go a royal commandment from him  and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes  that it be not altered  that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus  and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she  
20	and when the king s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire   for it is great   all the wives shall give to their husbands honour  both to great and small  
21	and the saying pleased the king and the princes  and the king did according to the word of memucan  
22	for he sent letters into all the king s provinces  into every province according to the writing thereof  and to every people after their language  that every man should bear rule in his own house  and that  it  should be published according to the language of every people  
esther 2
1 	after these things  when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased  he remembered vashti  and what she had done  and what was decreed against her  
2	then said the king s servants that ministered unto him  let there be fair young virgins sought for the king  
3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom  that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace  to the house of the women  unto the custody of hege the king s chamberlain  keeper of the women  and let their things for purification be given  them   
4	and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti  and the thing pleased the king  and he did so  
5	 now  in shushan the palace there was a certain jew  whose name  was  mordecai  the son of jair  the son of shimei  the son of kish  a benjamite  
6	who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah  whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away  
7	and he brought up hadassah  that  is   esther  his uncle s daughter  for she had neither father nor mother  and the maid  was  fair and beautiful  whom mordecai  when her father and mother were dead  took for his own daughter  
8	so it came to pass  when the king s commandment and his decree was heard  and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace  to the custody of hegai  that esther was brought also unto the king s house  to the custody of hegai  keeper of the women  
9	and the maiden pleased him  and she obtained kindness of him  and he speedily gave her her things for purification  with such things as belonged to her  and seven maidens   which were  meet to be given her  out of the king s house  and he preferred her and her maids unto the best  place  of the house of the women  
10	esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred  for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew  it   
11	and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women s house  to know how esther did  and what should become of her  
12	now when every maid s turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus  after that she had been twelve months  according to the manner of the women   for so were the days of their purifications accomplished   to wit   six months with oil of myrrh  and six months with sweet odours  and with  other  things for the purifying of the women   
13	then thus came  every  maiden unto the king  whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king s house  
14	in the evening she went  and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women  to the custody of shaashgaz  the king s chamberlain  which kept the concubines  she came in unto the king no more  except the king delighted in her  and that she were called by name  
15	now when the turn of esther  the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai  who had taken her for his daughter  was come to go in unto the king  she required nothing but what hegai the king s chamberlain  the keeper of the women  appointed  and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her  
16	so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month  which  is  the month tebeth  in the seventh year of his reign  
17	and the king loved esther above all the women  and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins  so that he set the royal crown upon her head  and made her queen instead of vashti  
18	then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants   even  esther s feast  and he made a release to the provinces  and gave gifts  according to the state of the king  
19	and when the virgins were gathered together the second time  then mordecai sat in the king s gate  
20	esther had not  yet  shewed her kindred nor her people  as mordecai had charged her  for esther did the commandment of mordecai  like as when she was brought up with him  
21 	in those days  while mordecai sat in the king s gate  two of the king s chamberlains  bigthan and teresh  of those which kept the door  were wroth  and sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus  
22	and the thing was known to mordecai  who told  it  unto esther the queen  and esther certified the king  thereof  in mordecai s name  
23	and when inquisition was made of the matter  it was found out  therefore they were both hanged on a tree  and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king  
esther 3
1 	after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  and advanced him  and set his seat above all the princes that  were  with him  
2	and all the king s servants  that  were  in the king s gate  bowed  and reverenced haman  for the king had so commanded concerning him  but mordecai bowed not  nor did  him  reverence  
3	then the king s servants  which  were  in the king s gate  said unto mordecai  why transgressest thou the king s commandment  
4	now it came to pass  when they spake daily unto him  and he hearkened not unto them  that they told haman  to see whether mordecai s matters would stand  for he had told them that he  was  a jew  
5	and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not  nor did him reverence  then was haman full of wrath  
6	and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone  for they had shewed him the people of mordecai  wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that  were  throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus   even  the people of mordecai  
7 	in the first month  that  is   the month nisan  in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus  they cast pur  that  is   the lot  before haman from day to day  and from month to month   to  the twelfth  month   that  is   the month adar  
8	and haman said unto king ahasuerus  there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom  and their laws  are  diverse from all people  neither keep they the king s laws  therefore it  is  not for the king s profit to suffer them  
9	if it please the king  let it be written that they may be destroyed  and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business  to bring  it  into the king s treasuries  
10	and the king took his ring from his hand  and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  the jews  enemy  
11	and the king said unto haman  the silver  is  given to thee  the people also  to do with them as it seemeth good to thee  
12	then were the king s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month  and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king s lieutenants  and to the governors that  were  over every province  and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof  and  to  every people after their language  in the name of king ahasuerus was it written  and sealed with the king s ring  
13	and the letters were sent by posts into all the king s provinces  to destroy  to kill  and to cause to perish  all jews  both young and old  little children and women  in one day   even  upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month  which is the month adar  and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey  
14	the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people  that they should be ready against that day  
15	the posts went out  being hastened by the king s commandment  and the decree was given in shushan the palace  and the king and haman sat down to drink  but the city shushan was perplexed  
esther 4
1 	when mordecai perceived all that was done  mordecai rent his clothes  and put on sackcloth with ashes  and went out into the midst of the city  and cried with a loud and a bitter cry  
2	and came even before the king s gate  for none  might  enter into the king s gate clothed with sackcloth  
3	and in every province  whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came   there was  great mourning among the jews  and fasting  and weeping  and wailing  and many lay in sackcloth and ashes  
4	so esther s maids and her chamberlains came and told  it  her  then was the queen exceedingly grieved  and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai  and to take away his sackcloth from him  but he received  it  not  
5 	then called esther for hatach   one  of the king s chamberlains  whom he had appointed to attend upon her  and gave him a commandment to mordecai  to know what it  was   and why it  was   
6	so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city  which  was  before the king s gate  
7	and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him  and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s treasuries for the jews  to destroy them  
8	also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them  to shew  it  unto esther  and to declare  it  unto her  and to charge her that she should go in unto the king  to make supplication unto him  and to make request before him for her people  
9	and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai  
10	again esther spake unto hatach  and gave him commandment unto mordecai  
11	all the king s servants  and the people of the king s provinces  do know  that whosoever  whether man or woman  shall come unto the king into the inner court  who is not called   there is  one law of his to put  him  to death  except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre  that he may live  but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days  
12	and they told to mordecai esther s words  
13	then mordecai commanded to answer esther  think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king s house  more than all the jews  
14	for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time   then  shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place  but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed  and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for  such  a time as this  
15	then esther bade  them  return mordecai  this answer   
16	go  gather together all the jews that are present in shushan  and fast ye for me  and neither eat nor drink three days  night or day  i also and my maidens will fast likewise  and so will i go in unto the king  which  is  not according to the law  and if i perish  i perish  
17	so mordecai went his way  and did according to all that esther had commanded him  
esther 5
1 	now it came to pass on the third day  that esther put on  her  royal  apparel   and stood in the inner court of the king s house  over against the king s house  and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house  over against the gate of the house  
2	and it was so  when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court   that  she obtained favour in his sight  and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that  was  in his hand  so esther drew near  and touched the top of the sceptre  
3	then said the king unto her  what wilt thou  queen esther  and what  is  thy request  it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom  
4	and esther answered  if  it seem  good unto the king  let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him  
5	then the king said  cause haman to make haste  that he may do as esther hath said  so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared  
6	and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine  what  is  thy petition  and it shall be granted thee  and what  is  thy request  even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed  
7	then answered esther  and said  my petition and my request  is   
8	if i have found favour in the sight of the king  and if it please the king to grant my petition  and to perform my request  let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them  and i will do to morrow as the king hath said  
9 	then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart  but when haman saw mordecai in the king s gate  that he stood not up  nor moved for him  he was full of indignation against mordecai  
10	nevertheless haman refrained himself  and when he came home  he sent and called for his friends  and zeresh his wife  
11	and haman told them of the glory of his riches  and the multitude of his children  and all  the things  wherein the king had promoted him  and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king  
12	haman said moreover  yea  esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself  and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king  
13	yet all this availeth me nothing  so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king s gate  
14	then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him  let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high  and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon  then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet  and the thing pleased haman  and he caused the gallows to be made  
esther 6
1 	on that night could not the king sleep  and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles  and they were read before the king  
2	and it was found written  that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh  two of the king s chamberlains  the keepers of the door  who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus  
3	and the king said  what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this  then said the king s servants that ministered unto him  there is nothing done for him  
4 	and the king said  who  is  in the court  now haman was come into the outward court of the king s house  to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him  
5	and the king s servants said unto him  behold  haman standeth in the court  and the king said  let him come in  
6	so haman came in  and the king said unto him  what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour  now haman thought in his heart  to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself  
7	and haman answered the king  for the man whom the king delighteth to honour  
8	let the royal apparel be brought which the king  useth  to wear  and the horse that the king rideth upon  and the crown royal which is set upon his head  
9	and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble princes  that they may array the man  withal  whom the king delighteth to honour  and bring him on horseback through the street of the city  and proclaim before him  thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour  
10	then the king said to haman  make haste   and  take the apparel and the horse  as thou hast said  and do even so to mordecai the jew  that sitteth at the king s gate  let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken  
11	then took haman the apparel and the horse  and arrayed mordecai  and brought him on horseback through the street of the city  and proclaimed before him  thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour  
12 	and mordecai came again to the king s gate  but haman hasted to his house mourning  and having his head covered  
13	and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every  thing  that had befallen him  then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him  if mordecai  be  of the seed of the jews  before whom thou hast begun to fall  thou shalt not prevail against him  but shalt surely fall before him  
14	and while they  were  yet talking with him  came the king s chamberlains  and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared  
esther 7
1 	so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen  
2	and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine  what  is  thy petition  queen esther  and it shall be granted thee  and what  is  thy request  and it shall be performed   even  to the half of the kingdom  
3	then esther the queen answered and said  if i have found favour in thy sight  o king  and if it please the king  let my life be given me at my petition  and my people at my request  
4	for we are sold  i and my people  to be destroyed  to be slain  and to perish  but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen  i had held my tongue  although the enemy could not countervail the king s damage  
5	then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen  who is he  and where is he  that durst presume in his heart to do so  
6	and esther said  the adversary and enemy  is  this wicked haman  then haman was afraid before the king and the queen  
7 	and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath  went  into the palace garden  and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen  for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king  
8	then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine  and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther  was   then said the king  will he force the queen also before me in the house  as the word went out of the king s mouth  they covered haman s face  
9	and harbonah  one of the chamberlains  said before the king  behold also  the gallows fifty cubits high  which haman had made for mordecai  who had spoken good for the king  standeth in the house of haman  then the king said  hang him thereon  
10	so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai  then was the king s wrath pacified  
esther 8
1 	on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews  enemy unto esther the queen  and mordecai came before the king  for esther had told what he  was  unto her  
2	and the king took off his ring  which he had taken from haman  and gave it unto mordecai  and esther set mordecai over the house of haman  
3 	and esther spake yet again before the king  and fell down at his feet  and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite  and his device that he had devised against the jews  
4	then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther  so esther arose  and stood before the king  
5	and said  if it please the king  and if i have found favour in his sight  and the thing  seem  right before the king  and i  be  pleasing in his eyes  let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite  which he wrote to destroy the jews which  are  in all the king s provinces  
6	for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people  or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred  
7	then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew  behold  i have given esther the house of haman  and him they have hanged upon the gallows  because he laid his hand upon the jews  
8	write ye also for the jews  as it liketh you  in the king s name  and seal  it  with the king s ring  for the writing which is written in the king s name  and sealed with the king s ring  may no man reverse  
9	then were the king s scribes called at that time in the third month  that  is   the month sivan  on the three and twentieth  day  thereof  and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews  and to the lieutenants  and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which  are  from india unto ethiopia  an hundred twenty and seven provinces  unto every province according to the writing thereof  and unto every people after their language  and to the jews according to their writing  and according to their language  
10	and he wrote in the king ahasuerus  name  and sealed  it  with the king s ring  and sent letters by posts on horseback   and  riders on mules  camels   and  young dromedaries  
11	wherein the king granted the jews which  were  in every city to gather themselves together  and to stand for their life  to destroy  to slay  and to cause to perish  all the power of the people and province that would assault them   both  little ones and women  and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey  
12	upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus   namely   upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month  which  is  the month adar  
13	the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province  was  published unto all people  and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies  
14	 so  the posts that rode upon mules  and  camels went out  being hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment  and the decree was given at shushan the palace  
15 	and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white  and with a great crown of gold  and with a garment of fine linen and purple  and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad  
16	the jews had light  and gladness  and joy  and honour  
17	and in every province  and in every city  whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came  the jews had joy and gladness  a feast and a good day  and many of the people of the land became jews  for the fear of the jews fell upon them  
esther 9
1 	now in the twelfth month  that  is   the month adar  on the thirteenth day of the same  when the king s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution  in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them   though it was turned to the contrary  that the jews had rule over them that hated them   
2	the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus  to lay hand on such as sought their hurt  and no man could withstand them  for the fear of them fell upon all people  
3	and all the rulers of the provinces  and the lieutenants  and the deputies  and officers of the king  helped the jews  because the fear of mordecai fell upon them  
4	for mordecai  was  great in the king s house  and his fame went out throughout all the provinces  for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater  
5	thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword  and slaughter  and destruction  and did what they would unto those that hated them  
6	and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men  
7	and parshandatha  and dalphon  and aspatha  
8	and poratha  and adalia  and aridatha  
9	and parmashta  and arisai  and aridai  and vajezatha  
10	the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha  the enemy of the jews  slew they  but on the spoil laid they not their hand  
11	on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king  
12	and the king said unto esther the queen  the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace  and the ten sons of haman  what have they done in the rest of the king s provinces  now what  is  thy petition  and it shall be granted thee  or what  is  thy request further  and it shall be done  
13	then said esther  if it please the king  let it be granted to the jews which  are  in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day s decree  and let haman s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows  
14	and the king commanded it so to be done  and the decree was given at shushan  and they hanged haman s ten sons  
15	for the jews that  were  in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar  and slew three hundred men at shushan  but on the prey they laid not their hand  
16	but the other jews that  were  in the king s provinces gathered themselves together  and stood for their lives  and had rest from their enemies  and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand  but they laid not their hands on the prey  
17	on the thirteenth day of the month adar  and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they  and made it a day of feasting and gladness  
18	but the jews that  were  at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth  day  thereof  and on the fourteenth thereof  and on the fifteenth  day  of the same they rested  and made it a day of feasting and gladness  
19	therefore the jews of the villages  that dwelt in the unwalled towns  made the fourteenth day of the month adar  a day of  gladness and feasting  and a good day  and of sending portions one to another  
20 	and mordecai wrote these things  and sent letters unto all the jews that  were  in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus   both  nigh and far  
21	to stablish  this  among them  that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar  and the fifteenth day of the same  yearly  
22	as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies  and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy  and from mourning into a good day  that they should make them days of feasting and joy  and of sending portions one to another  and gifts to the poor  
23	and the jews undertook to do as they had begun  and as mordecai had written unto them  
24	because haman the son of hammedatha  the agagite  the enemy of all the jews  had devised against the jews to destroy them  and had cast pur  that  is   the lot  to consume them  and to destroy them  
25	but when  esther  came before the king  he commanded by letters that his wicked device  which he devised against the jews  should return upon his own head  and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows  
26	wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur  therefore for all the words of this letter  and  of that  which they had seen concerning this matter  and which had come unto them  
27	the jews ordained  and took upon them  and upon their seed  and upon all such as joined themselves unto them  so as it should not fail  that they would keep these two days according to their writing  and according to their  appointed  time every year  
28	and  that  these days  should be  remembered and kept throughout every generation  every family  every province  and every city  and  that  these days of purim should not fail from among the jews  nor the memorial of them perish from their seed  
29	then esther the queen  the daughter of abihail  and mordecai the jew  wrote with all authority  to confirm this second letter of purim  
30	and he sent the letters unto all the jews  to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus   with  words of peace and truth  
31	to confirm these days of purim in their times  appointed   according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them  and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed  the matters of the fastings and their cry  
32	and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim  and it was written in the book  
esther 10
1 	and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land  and  upon  the isles of the sea  
2	and all the acts of his power and of his might  and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai  whereunto the king advanced him   are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia  
3	for mordecai the jew  was  next unto king ahasuerus  and great among the jews  and accepted of the multitude of his brethren  seeking the wealth of his people  and speaking peace to all his seed

job 1
1 	there was a man in the land of uz  whose name  was  job  and that man was perfect and upright  and one that feared god  and eschewed evil  
2	and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters  
3	his substance also was seven thousand sheep  and three thousand camels  and five hundred yoke of oxen  and five hundred she asses  and a very great household  so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east  
4 	and his sons went and feasted  in their  houses  every one his day  and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them  
5	and it was so  when the days of  their  feasting were gone about  that job sent and sanctified them  and rose up early in the morning  and offered burnt offerings  according  to the number of them all  for job said  it may be that my sons have sinned  and cursed god in their hearts  thus did job continually  
6 	now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord  and satan came also among them  
7	and the lord said unto satan  whence comest thou  then satan answered the lord  and said  from going to and fro in the earth  and from walking up and down in it  
8	and the lord said unto satan  hast thou considered my servant job  that  there is  none like him in the earth  a perfect and an upright man  one that feareth god  and escheweth evil  
9	then satan answered the lord  and said  doth job fear god for nought  
10	hast not thou made an hedge about him  and about his house  and about all that he hath on every side  thou hast blessed the work of his hands  and his substance is increased in the land  
11	but put forth thine hand now  and touch all that he hath  and he will curse thee to thy face  
12	and the lord said unto satan  behold  all that he hath  is  in thy power  only upon himself put not forth thine hand  so satan went forth from the presence of the lord  
13 	and there was a day when his sons and his daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house  
14	and there came a messenger unto job  and said  the oxen were plowing  and the asses feeding beside them  
15	and the sabeans fell  upon them   and took them away  yea  they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee  
16	while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  the fire of god is fallen from heaven  and hath burned up the sheep  and the servants  and consumed them  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee  
17	while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  the chaldeans made out three bands  and fell upon the camels  and have carried them away  yea  and slain the servants with the edge of the sword  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee  
18	while he  was  yet speaking  there came also another  and said  thy sons and thy daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house  
19	and  behold  there came a great wind from the wilderness  and smote the four corners of the house  and it fell upon the young men  and they are dead  and i only am escaped alone to tell thee  
20 	then job arose  and rent his mantle  and shaved his head  and fell down upon the ground  and worshipped  
21	and said  naked came i out of my mother s womb  and naked shall i return thither  the lord gave  and the lord hath taken away  blessed be the name of the lord  
22	in all this job sinned not  nor charged god foolishly  
job 2
1 	again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord  and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord  
2	and the lord said unto satan  from whence comest thou  and satan answered the lord  and said  from going to and fro in the earth  and from walking up and down in it  
3	and the lord said unto satan  hast thou considered my servant job  that  there is  none like him in the earth  a perfect and an upright man  one that feareth god  and escheweth evil  and still he holdeth fast his integrity  although thou movedst me against him  to destroy him without cause  
4	and satan answered the lord  and said  skin for skin  yea  all that a man hath will he give for his life  
5	but put forth thine hand now  and touch his bone and his flesh  and he will curse thee to thy face  
6	and the lord said unto satan  behold  he  is  in thine hand  but save his life  
7 	so went satan forth from the presence of the lord  and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown  
8	and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal  and he sat down among the ashes  
9	then said his wife unto him  dost thou still retain thine integrity  curse god  and die  
10	but he said unto her  thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh  what  shall we receive good at the hand of god  and shall we not receive evil  in all this did not job sin with his lips  
11 	now when job s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him  they came every one from his own place  eliphaz the temanite  and bildad the shuhite  and zophar the naamathite  for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him  
12	and when they lifted up their eyes afar off  and knew him not  they lifted up their voice  and wept  and they rent every one his mantle  and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven  
13	so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights  and none spake a word unto him  for they saw that  his  grief was very great  
job 3
1 	after this opened job his mouth  and cursed his day  
2	and job spake  and said  
3	let the day perish wherein i was born  and the night  in which  it was said  there is a man child conceived  
4	let that day be darkness  let not god regard it from above  neither let the light shine upon it  
5	let darkness and the shadow of death stain it  let a cloud dwell upon it  let the blackness of the day terrify it  
6	as  for  that night  let darkness seize upon it  let it not be joined unto the days of the year  let it not come into the number of the months  
7	lo  let that night be solitary  let no joyful voice come therein  
8	let them curse it that curse the day  who are ready to raise up their mourning  
9	let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark  let it look for light  but  have  none  neither let it see the dawning of the day  
10	because it shut not up the doors of my  mother s  womb  nor hid sorrow from mine eyes  
11 	why died i not from the womb   why  did i  not  give up the ghost when i came out of the belly  
12	why did the knees prevent me  or why the breasts that i should suck  
13	for now should i have lain still and been quiet  i should have slept  then had i been at rest  
14	with kings and counsellors of the earth  which built desolate places for themselves  
15	or with princes that had gold  who filled their houses with silver  
16	or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been  as infants  which  never saw light  
17	there the wicked cease  from  troubling  and there the weary be at rest  
18	 there  the prisoners rest together  they hear not the voice of the oppressor  
19	the small and great are there  and the servant  is  free from his master  
20 	wherefore is light given to him that is in misery  and life unto the bitter  in  soul  
21	which long for death  but it  cometh  not  and dig for it more than for hid treasures  
22	which rejoice exceedingly   and  are glad  when they can find the grave  
23	 why is light given  to a man whose way is hid  and whom god hath hedged in  
24	for my sighing cometh before i eat  and my roarings are poured out like the waters  
25	for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me  and that which i was afraid of is come unto me  
26	i was not in safety  neither had i rest  neither was i quiet  yet trouble came  
job 4
1 	then eliphaz the temanite answered and said  
2	 if  we assay to commune with thee  wilt thou be grieved  but who can withhold himself from speaking  
3	behold  thou hast instructed many  and thou hast strengthened the weak hands  
4	thy words have upholden him that was falling  and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees  
5	but now it is come upon thee  and thou faintest  it toucheth thee  and thou art troubled  
6	 is  not  this  thy fear  thy confidence  thy hope  and the uprightness of thy ways  
7 	remember  i pray thee  who  ever  perished  being innocent  or where were the righteous cut off  
8	even as i have seen  they that plow iniquity  and sow wickedness  reap the same  
9	by the blast of god they perish  and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed  
10	the roaring of the lion  and the voice of the fierce lion  and the teeth of the young lions  are broken  
11	the old lion perisheth for lack of prey  and the stout lion s whelps are scattered abroad  
12 	now a thing was secretly brought to me  and mine ear received a little thereof  
13	in thoughts from the visions of the night  when deep sleep falleth on men  
14	fear came upon me  and trembling  which made all my bones to shake  
15	then a spirit passed before my face  the hair of my flesh stood up  
16	it stood still  but i could not discern the form thereof  an image  was  before mine eyes   there was  silence  and i heard a voice   saying   
17	shall mortal man be more just than god  shall a man be more pure than his maker  
18	behold  he put no trust in his servants  and his angels he charged with folly  
19	how much less  in  them that dwell in houses of clay  whose foundation  is  in the dust   which  are crushed before the moth  
20	they are destroyed from morning to evening  they perish for ever without any regarding  it   
21	doth not their excellency  which is  in them go away  they die  even without wisdom  
job 5
1 	call now  if there be any that will answer thee  and to which of the saints wilt thou turn  
2	for wrath killeth the foolish man  and envy slayeth the silly one  
3	i have seen the foolish taking root  but suddenly i cursed his habitation  
4	his children are far from safety  and they are crushed in the gate  neither  is there  any to deliver  them   
5	whose harvest the hungry eateth up  and taketh it even out of the thorns  and the robber swalloweth up their substance  
6 	although affliction cometh not forth of the dust  neither doth trouble spring out of the ground  
7	yet man is born unto trouble  as the sparks fly upward  
8	i would seek unto god  and unto god would i commit my cause  
9	which doeth great things and unsearchable  marvellous things without number  
10	who giveth rain upon the earth  and sendeth waters upon the fields  
11	to set up on high those that be low  that those which mourn may be exalted to safety  
12	he disappointeth the devices of the crafty  so that their hands cannot perform  their  enterprise  
13	he taketh the wise in their own craftiness  and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong  
14	they meet with darkness in the daytime  and grope in the noonday as in the night  
15	but he saveth the poor from the sword  from their mouth  and from the hand of the mighty  
16	so the poor hath hope  and iniquity stoppeth her mouth  
17 	behold  happy  is  the man whom god correcteth  therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty  
18	for he maketh sore  and bindeth up  he woundeth  and his hands make whole  
19	he shall deliver thee in six troubles  yea  in seven there shall no evil touch thee  
20	in famine he shall redeem thee from death  and in war from the power of the sword  
21	thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue  neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh  
22	at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh  neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth  
23	for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field  and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee  
24	and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle  shall be  in peace  and thou shalt visit thy habitation  and shalt not sin  
25	thou shalt know also that thy seed  shall be  great  and thine offspring as the grass of the earth  
26	thou shalt come to  thy  grave in a full age  like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season

job 6
1 	but job answered and said  
2	oh that my grief were throughly weighed  and my calamity laid in the balances together  
3	for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea  therefore my words are swallowed up  
4	for the arrows of the almighty  are  within me  the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit  the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me  
5	doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass  or loweth the ox over his fodder  
6	can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt  or is there  any  taste in the white of an egg  
7	the things  that  my soul refused to touch  are  as my sorrowful meat  
8 	oh that i might have my request  and that god would grant  me  the thing that i long for  
9	even that it would please god to destroy me  that he would let loose his hand  and cut me off  
10	then should i yet have comfort  yea  i would harden myself in sorrow  let him not spare  for i have not concealed the words of the holy one  
11	what  is  my strength  that i should hope  and what  is  mine end  that i should prolong my life  
12	 is  my strength the strength of stones  or  is  my flesh of brass  
13	 is  not my help in me  and is wisdom driven quite from me  
14 	to him that is afflicted pity  should be shewed  from his friend  but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty  
15	my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook   and  as the stream of brooks they pass away

17	what time they wax warm  they vanish  when it is hot  they are consumed out of their place  
18	the paths of their way are turned aside  they go to nothing  and perish  
19	the troops of tema looked  the companies of sheba waited for them  
20	they were confounded because they had hoped  they came thither  and were ashamed  
21	for now ye are nothing  ye see  my  casting down  and are afraid  
22 	did i say  bring unto me  or  give a reward for me of your substance  
23	or  deliver me from the enemy s hand  or  redeem me from the hand of the mighty  
24	teach me  and i will hold my tongue  and cause me to understand wherein i have erred  
25	how forcible are right words  but what doth your arguing reprove  
26	do ye imagine to reprove words  and the speeches of one that is desperate   which are  as wind  
27	yea  ye overwhelm the fatherless  and ye dig  a pit  for your friend  
28	now therefore be content  look upon me  for  it is  evident unto you if i lie

job 7
1 	 is there  not an appointed time to man upon earth   are not  his days also like the days of an hireling  
2	as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow  and as an hireling looketh for  the reward of  his work  
3	so am i made to possess months of vanity  and wearisome nights are appointed to me  
4	when i lie down  i say  when shall i arise  and the night be gone  and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day  
5	my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust  my skin is broken  and become loathsome  
6	my days are swifter than a weaver s shuttle  and are spent without hope

8	the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no  more   thine eyes  are  upon me  and i  am  not

job 8
1 	then answered bildad the shuhite  and said  
2	how long wilt thou speak these  things   and  how long shall  the words of thy mouth  be like  a strong wind  
3	doth god pervert judgment  or doth the almighty pervert justice  
4	if thy children have sinned against him  and he have cast them away for their transgression  
5	if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes  and make thy supplication to the almighty  
6	if thou  wert  pure and upright  surely now he would awake for thee  and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous  
7	though thy beginning was small  yet thy latter end should greatly increase  
8 	for enquire  i pray thee  of the former age  and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers

2	i know  it is  so of a truth  but how should man be just with god  
3	if he will contend with him  he cannot answer him one of a thousand  
4	 he is  wise in heart  and mighty in strength  who hath hardened  himself  against him  and hath prospered

13	 if  god will not withdraw his anger  the proud helpers do stoop under him  
14 	how much less shall i answer him   and  choose out my words  to reason  with him  
15	whom  though i were righteous   yet  would i not answer   but  i would make supplication to my judge  
16	if i had called  and he had answered me   yet  would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice  
17	for he breaketh me with a tempest  and multiplieth my wounds without cause  
18	he will not suffer me to take my breath  but filleth me with bitterness

1 	then eliphaz the temanite answered and said  
2	can a man be profitable unto god  as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself  
3	 is it  any pleasure to the almighty  that thou art righteous  or  is it  gain  to him   that thou makest thy ways perfect  
4	will he reprove thee for fear of thee  will he enter with thee into judgment  
5 	 is  not thy wickedness great  and thine iniquities infinite  
6	for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought  and stripped the naked of their clothing  
7	thou hast not given water to the weary to drink  and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry  
8	but  as for  the mighty man  he had the earth  and the honourable man dwelt in it  
9	thou hast sent widows away empty  and the arms of the fatherless have been broken  
10	therefore snares  are  round about thee  and sudden fear troubleth thee  
11	or darkness   that  thou canst not see  and abundance of waters cover thee  
12	 is  not god in the height of heaven  and behold the height of the stars  how high they are  
13	and thou sayest  how doth god know  can he judge through the dark cloud  
14	thick clouds  are  a covering to him  that he seeth not  and he walketh in the circuit of heaven  
15 	hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden  
16	which were cut down out of time  whose foundation was overflown with a flood  
17	which said unto god  depart from us  and what can the almighty do for them  
18	yet he filled their houses with good  things   but the counsel of the wicked is far from me  
19	the righteous see  it   and are glad  and the innocent laugh them to scorn  
20	whereas our substance is not cut down  but the remnant of them the fire consumeth  
21 	acquaint now thyself with him  and be at peace  thereby good shall come unto thee  
22	receive  i pray thee  the law from his mouth  and lay up his words in thine heart  
23	if thou return to the almighty  thou shalt be built up  thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles  
24	then shalt thou lay up gold as dust  and the  gold  of ophir as the stones of the brooks  
25	yea  the almighty shall be thy defence  and thou shalt have plenty of silver  
26	for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty  and shalt lift up thy face unto god  
27	thou shalt make thy prayer unto him  and he shall hear thee  and thou shalt pay thy vows  
28	thou shalt also decree a thing  and it shall be established unto thee  and the light shall shine upon thy ways  
29	when  men  are cast down  then thou shalt say   there is  lifting up  and he shall save the humble person

18	he keepeth back his soul from the pit  and his life from perishing by the sword

1 	furthermore elihu answered and said  
2	hear my words  o ye wise  men   and give ear unto me  ye that have knowledge  
3	for the ear trieth words  as the mouth tasteth meat  
4	let us choose to us judgment  let us know among ourselves what  is  good  
5	for job hath said  i am righteous  and god hath taken away my judgment  
6	should i lie against my right  my wound  is  incurable without transgression  
7	what man  is  like job   who  drinketh up scorning like water  
8	which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity  and walketh with wicked men  
9	for he hath said  it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god  
10 	therefore hearken unto me  ye men of understanding  far be it from god   that he should do  wickedness  and  from  the almighty   that he should commit  iniquity  
11	for the work of a man shall he render unto him  and cause every man to find according to  his  ways  
12	yea  surely god will not do wickedly  neither will the almighty pervert judgment  
13	who hath given him a charge over the earth  or who hath disposed the whole world  
14	if he set his heart upon man   if  he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath  
15	all flesh shall perish together  and man shall turn again unto dust  
16 	if now  thou hast  understanding  hear this  hearken to the voice of my words  
17	shall even he that hateth right govern  and wilt thou condemn him that is most just  
18	 is it fit  to say to a king   thou art  wicked   and  to princes   ye are  ungodly  
19	 how much less to him  that accepteth not the persons of princes  nor regardeth the rich more than the poor  for they all  are  the work of his hands  
20	in a moment shall they die  and the people shall be troubled at midnight  and pass away  and the mighty shall be taken away without hand  
21	for his eyes  are  upon the ways of man  and he seeth all his goings  
22	 there is  no darkness  nor shadow of death  where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves  
23	for he will not lay upon man more  than right   that he should enter into judgment with god  
24	he shall break in pieces mighty men without number  and set others in their stead  
25	therefore he knoweth their works  and he overturneth  them  in the night  so that they are destroyed  
26	he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others  
27	because they turned back from him  and would not consider any of his ways  
28	so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him  and he heareth the cry of the afflicted  
29	when he giveth quietness  who then can make trouble  and when he hideth  his  face  who then can behold him  whether  it be done  against a nation  or against a man only  
30	that the hypocrite reign not  lest the people be ensnared  
31 	surely it is meet to be said unto god  i have borne  chastisement   i will not offend  any more   
32	 that which  i see not teach thou me  if i have done iniquity  i will do no more  
33	 should it be  according to thy mind  he will recompense it  whether thou refuse  or whether thou choose  and not i  therefore speak what thou knowest  
34	let men of understanding tell me  and let a wise man hearken unto me  
35	job hath spoken without knowledge  and his words  were  without wisdom  
36	my desire  is that  job may be tried unto the end because of  his  answers for wicked men  
37	for he addeth rebellion unto his sin  he clappeth  his hands  among us  and multiplieth his words against god  
job 35
1 	elihu spake moreover  and said  
2	thinkest thou this to be right   that  thou saidst  my righteousness  is  more than god s  
3	for thou saidst  what advantage will it be unto thee   and   what profit shall i have   if i be cleansed  from my sin  
4	i will answer thee  and thy companions with thee  
5	look unto the heavens  and see  and behold the clouds  which  are higher than thou  
6	if thou sinnest  what doest thou against him  or  if  thy transgressions be multiplied  what doest thou unto him  
7	if thou be righteous  what givest thou him  or what receiveth he of thine hand  
8	thy wickedness  may hurt  a man as thou  art   and thy righteousness  may profit  the son of man  
9 	by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make  the oppressed  to cry  they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty  
10	but none saith  where  is  god my maker  who giveth songs in the night  
11	who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth  and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven  
12	there they cry  but none giveth answer  because of the pride of evil men  
13	surely god will not hear vanity  neither will the almighty regard it  
14 	although thou sayest thou shalt not see him   yet  judgment  is  before him  therefore trust thou in him  
15	but now  because  it is  not  so   he hath visited in his anger  yet he knoweth  it  not in great extremity  
16	therefore doth job open his mouth in vain  he multiplieth words without knowledge  
job 36
1 	elihu also proceeded  and said  
2	suffer me a little  and i will shew thee that  i have  yet to speak on god s behalf  
3	i will fetch my knowledge from afar  and will ascribe righteousness to my maker  
4	for truly my words  shall  not  be  false  he that is perfect in knowledge  is  with thee  
5 	behold  god  is  mighty  and despiseth not  any  he is  mighty in strength  and  wisdom  
6	he preserveth not the life of the wicked  but giveth right to the poor  
7	he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous  but with kings  are they  on the throne  yea  he doth establish them for ever  and they are exalted  
8	and if  they be  bound in fetters   and  be holden in cords of affliction  
9	then he sheweth them their work  and their transgressions that they have exceeded  
10	he openeth also their ear to discipline  and commandeth that they return from iniquity  
11	if they obey and serve  him   they shall spend their days in prosperity  and their years in pleasures  
12	but if they obey not  they shall perish by the sword  and they shall die without knowledge  
13	but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath  they cry not when he bindeth them  
14	they die in youth  and their life  is  among the unclean  
15 	he delivereth the poor in his affliction  and openeth their ears in oppression  
16	even so would he have removed thee out of the strait  into  a broad place  where  there is  no straitness  and that which should be set on thy table  should be  full of fatness  
17	but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked  judgment and justice take hold  on thee   
18	because  there is  wrath   beware  lest he take thee away with  his  stroke  then a great ransom cannot deliver thee  
19	will he esteem thy riches   no   not gold  nor all the forces of strength  
20	desire not the night  when people are cut off in their place  
21	take heed  regard not iniquity  for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction  
22	behold  god exalteth by his power  who teacheth like him  
23	who hath enjoined him his way  or who can say  thou hast wrought iniquity  
24 	remember that thou magnify his work  which men behold  
25	every man may see it  man may behold  it  afar off  
26	behold  god  is  great  and we know  him  not  neither can the number of his years be searched out  
27	for he maketh small the drops of water  they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof  
28	which the clouds do drop  and  distil upon man abundantly  
29	also can  any  understand the spreadings of the clouds   or  the noise of his tabernacle  
30	behold  he spreadeth his light upon it  and covereth the bottom of the sea  
31	for by them judgeth he the people  he giveth meat in abundance  
32	with clouds he covereth the light  and commandeth it  not to shine  by  the cloud  that cometh betwixt  
33	the noise thereof sheweth concerning it  the cattle also concerning the vapour  
job 37
1 	at this also my heart trembleth  and is moved out of his place  
2	hear attentively the noise of his voice  and the sound  that  goeth out of his mouth  
3	he directeth it under the whole heaven  and his lightning unto the ends of the earth  
4	after it a voice roareth  he thundereth with the voice of his excellency  and he will not stay them when his voice is heard  
5	god thundereth marvellously with his voice  great things doeth he  which we cannot comprehend  
6 	for he saith to the snow  be thou  on  the earth  likewise to the small rain  and to the great rain of his strength  
7	he sealeth up the hand of every man  that all men may know his work  
8	then the beasts go into dens  and remain in their places  
9	out of the south cometh the whirlwind  and cold out of the north  
10	by the breath of god frost is given  and the breadth of the waters is straitened  
11	also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud  he scattereth his bright cloud  
12	and it is turned round about by his counsels  that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth  
13	he causeth it to come  whether for correction  or for his land  or for mercy  
14 	hearken unto this  o job  stand still  and consider the wondrous works of god  
15	dost thou know when god disposed them  and caused the light of his cloud to shine  
16	dost thou know the balancings of the clouds  the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge  
17	how thy garments  are  warm  when he quieteth the earth by the south  wind   
18	hast thou with him spread out the sky   which is  strong   and  as a molten looking glass  
19	teach us what we shall say unto him   for  we cannot order  our speech  by reason of darkness  
20	shall it be told him that i speak  if a man speak  surely he shall be swallowed up  
21 	and now  men  see not the bright light which  is  in the clouds  but the wind passeth  and cleanseth them  
22	fair weather cometh out of the north  with god  is  terrible majesty  
23	 touching  the almighty  we cannot find him out   he is  excellent in power  and in judgment  and in plenty of justice  he will not afflict  
24	men do therefore fear him  he respecteth not any  that are  wise of heart

job 42
1 	then job answered the lord  and said  
2	i know that thou canst do every  thing   and  that  no thought can be withholden from thee  
3	who  is  he that hideth counsel without knowledge  therefore have i uttered that i understood not  things too wonderful for me  which i knew not  
4	hear  i beseech thee  and i will speak  i will demand of thee  and declare thou unto me  
5	i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear  but now mine eye seeth thee  
6	wherefore i abhor  myself   and repent in dust and ashes  
7 	and it was  so   that after the lord had spoken these words unto job  the lord said to eliphaz the temanite  my wrath is kindled against thee  and against thy two friends  for ye have not spoken of me  the thing that is  right  as my servant job  hath   
8	therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams  and go to my servant job  and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering  and my servant job shall pray for you  for him will i accept  lest i deal with you  after your  folly  in that ye have not spoken of me  the thing which is  right  like my servant job  
9	so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite  and  zophar the naamathite went  and did according as the lord commanded them  the lord also accepted job  
10 	and the lord turned the captivity of job  when he prayed for his friends  also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before  
11	then came there unto him all his brethren  and all his sisters  and all they that had been of his acquaintance before  and did eat bread with him in his house  and they bemoaned him  and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him  every man also gave him a piece of money  and every one an earring of gold  
12	so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning  for he had fourteen thousand sheep  and six thousand camels  and a thousand yoke of oxen  and a thousand she asses  
13	he had also seven sons and three daughters  
14	and he called the name of the first  jemima  and the name of the second  kezia  and the name of the third  kerenhappuch  
15	and in all the land were no women found  so  fair as the daughters of job  and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren  
16	after this lived job an hundred and forty years  and saw his sons  and his sons  sons   even  four generations

psalms
psalm 1
1 	blessed  is  the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly  nor standeth in the way of sinners  nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful  
2	but his delight  is  in the law of the lord  and in his law doth he meditate day and night  
3	and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water  that bringeth forth his fruit in his season  his leaf also shall not wither  and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper  
4 	the ungodly  are  not so  but  are  like the chaff which the wind driveth away  
5	therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment  nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous  
6	for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous  but the way of the ungodly shall perish  
psalm 2
1 	why do the heathen rage  and the people imagine a vain thing  
2	the kings of the earth set themselves  and the rulers take counsel together  against the lord  and against his anointed   saying   
3	let us break their bands asunder  and cast away their cords from us  
4	he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh  the lord shall have them in derision  
5	then shall he speak unto them in his wrath  and vex them in his sore displeasure  
6	yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion  
7 	i will declare the decree  the lord hath said unto me  thou  art  my son  this day have i begotten thee  
8	ask of me  and i shall give  thee  the heathen  for  thine inheritance  and the uttermost parts of the earth  for  thy possession  
9	thou shalt break them with a rod of iron  thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter s vessel

psalm 18
1 	to the chief musician   a psalm  of david  the servant of the lord  who spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day  that  the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies  and from the hand of saul  and he said  i will love thee  o lord  my strength  
2	the lord  is  my rock  and my fortress  and my deliverer  my god  my strength  in whom i will trust  my buckler  and the horn of my salvation   and  my high tower  
3	i will call upon the lord   who is worthy  to be praised  so shall i be saved from mine enemies  
4	the sorrows of death compassed me  and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid  
5	the sorrows of hell compassed me about  the snares of death prevented me  
6	in my distress i called upon the lord  and cried unto my god  he heard my voice out of his temple  and my cry came before him   even  into his ears  
7	then the earth shook and trembled  the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken  because he was wroth  
8	there went up a smoke out of his nostrils  and fire out of his mouth devoured  coals were kindled by it  
9	he bowed the heavens also  and came down  and darkness  was  under his feet  
10	and he rode upon a cherub  and did fly  yea  he did fly upon the wings of the wind  
11	he made darkness his secret place  his pavilion round about him  were  dark waters  and  thick clouds of the skies  
12	at the brightness  that was  before him his thick clouds passed  hail  stones  and coals of fire  
13	the lord also thundered in the heavens  and the highest gave his voice  hail  stones  and coals of fire  
14	yea  he sent out his arrows  and scattered them  and he shot out lightnings  and discomfited them  
15	then the channels of waters were seen  and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke  o lord  at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils  
16	he sent from above  he took me  he drew me out of many waters  
17	he delivered me from my strong enemy  and from them which hated me  for they were too strong for me  
18	they prevented me in the day of my calamity  but the lord was my stay  
19	he brought me forth also into a large place  he delivered me  because he delighted in me  
20 	the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness  according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me  
21	for i have kept the ways of the lord  and have not wickedly departed from my god  
22	for all his judgments  were  before me  and i did not put away his statutes from me  
23	i was also upright before him  and i kept myself from mine iniquity

25	with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful  with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright  
26	with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure  and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward  
27	for thou wilt save the afflicted people  but wilt bring down high looks  
28	for thou wilt light my candle  the lord my god will enlighten my darkness  
29 	for by thee i have run through a troop  and by my god have i leaped over a wall  
30	 as for  god  his way  is  perfect  the word of the lord is tried  he  is  a buckler to all those that trust in him  
31	for who  is  god save the lord  or who  is  a rock save our god  
32	 it is  god that girdeth me with strength  and maketh my way perfect  
33	he maketh my feet like hinds   feet   and setteth me upon my high places  
34	he teacheth my hands to war  so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms  
35	thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation  and thy right hand hath holden me up  and thy gentleness hath made me great  
36	thou hast enlarged my steps under me  that my feet did not slip  
37	i have pursued mine enemies  and overtaken them  neither did i turn again till they were consumed  
38	i have wounded them that they were not able to rise  they are fallen under my feet  
39	for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle  thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me  
40	thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies  that i might destroy them that hate me  
41	they cried  but  there was  none to save  them  even  unto the lord  but he answered them not  
42	then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind  i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets  
43	thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people   and  thou hast made me the head of the heathen  a people  whom  i have not known shall serve me  
44	as soon as they hear of me  they shall obey me  the strangers shall submit themselves unto me  
45	the strangers shall fade away  and be afraid out of their close places  
46	the lord liveth  and blessed  be  my rock  and let the god of my salvation be exalted  
47	 it is  god that avengeth me  and subdueth the people under me  
48	he delivereth me from mine enemies  yea  thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me  thou hast delivered me from the violent man

20	but the wicked shall perish  and the enemies of the lord  shall be  as the fat of lambs  they shall consume  into smoke shall they consume away

psalm 38
1 	a psalm of david  to bring to remembrance  o lord  rebuke me not in thy wrath  neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure  
2	for thine arrows stick fast in me  and thy hand presseth me sore  
3	 there is  no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger  neither  is there any  rest in my bones because of my sin  
4	for mine iniquities are gone over mine head  as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me  
5	my wounds stink  and  are corrupt because of my foolishness  
6	i am troubled  i am bowed down greatly  i go mourning all the day long  
7	for my loins are filled with a loathsome  disease   and  there is  no soundness in my flesh  
8	i am feeble and sore broken  i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart  
9	lord  all my desire  is  before thee  and my groaning is not hid from thee  
10	my heart panteth  my strength faileth me  as for the light of mine eyes  it also is gone from me  
11	my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore  and my kinsmen stand afar off  
12 	they also that seek after my life lay snares  for me   and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things  and imagine deceits all the day long  
13	but i  as a deaf  man   heard not  and  i was  as a dumb man  that  openeth not his mouth  
14	thus i was as a man that heareth not  and in whose mouth  are  no reproofs  
15	for in thee  o lord  do i hope  thou wilt hear  o lord my god  
16	for i said   hear me   lest  otherwise  they should rejoice over me  when my foot slippeth  they magnify  themselves  against me  
17	for i  am  ready to halt  and my sorrow  is  continually before me  
18	for i will declare mine iniquity  i will be sorry for my sin  
19	but mine enemies  are  lively   and  they are strong  and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied  
20	they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries  because i follow  the thing that  good  is   
21	forsake me not  o lord  o my god  be not far from me  
22	make haste to help me  o lord my salvation  
psalm 39
1 	to the chief musician   even  to jeduthun  a psalm of david  i said  i will take heed to my ways  that i sin not with my tongue  i will keep my mouth with a bridle  while the wicked is before me  
2	i was dumb with silence  i held my peace   even  from good  and my sorrow was stirred  
3	my heart was hot within me  while i was musing the fire burned   then  spake i with my tongue  
4	lord  make me to know mine end  and the measure of my days  what it  is  that  i may know how frail i  am   
5	behold  thou hast made my days  as  an handbreadth  and mine age  is  as nothing before thee  verily every man at his best state  is  altogether vanity  selah  
6	surely every man walketh in a vain shew  surely they are disquieted in vain  he heapeth up  riches   and knoweth not who shall gather them  
7 	and now  lord  what wait i for  my hope  is  in thee  
8	deliver me from all my transgressions  make me not the reproach of the foolish  
9	i was dumb  i opened not my mouth  because thou didst  it   
10	remove thy stroke away from me  i am consumed by the blow of thine hand  
11	when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity  thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth  surely every man  is  vanity  selah  
12	hear my prayer  o lord  and give ear unto my cry  hold not thy peace at my tears  for i  am  a stranger with thee   and  a sojourner  as all my fathers  were   
13	o spare me  that i may recover strength  before i go hence  and be no more  
psalm 40
1 	to the chief musician  a psalm of david  i waited patiently for the lord  and he inclined unto me  and heard my cry  
2	he brought me up also out of an horrible pit  out of the miry clay  and set my feet upon a rock   and  established my goings  
3	and he hath put a new song in my mouth   even  praise unto our god  many shall see  it   and fear  and shall trust in the lord  
4	blessed  is  that man that maketh the lord his trust  and respecteth not the proud  nor such as turn aside to lies  
5	many  o lord my god   are  thy wonderful works  which  thou hast done  and thy thoughts  which are  to us ward  they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee   if  i would declare and speak  of them   they are more than can be numbered  
6 	sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire  mine ears hast thou opened  burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required  
7	then said i  lo  i come  in the volume of the book  it is  written of me  
8	i delight to do thy will  o my god  yea  thy law  is  within my heart  
9	i have preached righteousness in the great congregation  lo  i have not refrained my lips  o lord  thou knowest  
10	i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart  i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation  i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation  
11 	withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me  o lord  let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me  
12	for innumerable evils have compassed me about  mine iniquities have taken hold upon me  so that i am not able to look up  they are more than the hairs of mine head  therefore my heart faileth me  
13	be pleased  o lord  to deliver me  o lord  make haste to help me  
14	let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it  let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil  
15	let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me  aha  aha  
16	let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee  let such as love thy salvation say continually  the lord be magnified  
17	but i  am  poor and needy   yet  the lord thinketh upon me  thou  art  my help and my deliverer  make no tarrying  o my god  
psalm 41
1 	to the chief musician  a psalm of david  blessed  is  he that considereth the poor  the lord will deliver him in time of trouble  
2	the lord will preserve him  and keep him alive   and  he shall be blessed upon the earth  and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies  
3	the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing  thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness  
4	i said  lord  be merciful unto me  heal my soul  for i have sinned against thee  
5 	mine enemies speak evil of me  when shall he die  and his name perish  
6	and if he come to see  me   he speaketh vanity  his heart gathereth iniquity to itself   when  he goeth abroad  he telleth  it   
7	all that hate me whisper together against me  against me do they devise my hurt  
8	an evil disease   say they   cleaveth fast unto him  and  now  that he lieth he shall rise up no more  
9	yea  mine own familiar friend  in whom i trusted  which did eat of my bread  hath lifted up  his  heel against me  
10	but thou  o lord  be merciful unto me  and raise me up  that i may requite them  
11	by this i know that thou favourest me  because mine enemy doth not triumph over me

13	blessed  be  the lord god of israel from everlasting  and to everlasting  amen  and amen

1 	to the chief musician  maschil  for the sons of korah  as the hart panteth after the water brooks  so panteth my soul after thee  o god  
2	my soul thirsteth for god  for the living god  when shall i come and appear before god  
3	my tears have been my meat day and night  while they continually say unto me  where  is  thy god  
4	when i remember these  things   i pour out my soul in me  for i had gone with the multitude  i went with them to the house of god  with the voice of joy and praise  with a multitude that kept holyday

8	 yet  the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime  and in the night his song  shall be  with me   and  my prayer unto the god of my life  
9	i will say unto god my rock  why hast thou forgotten me  why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy  
10	 as  with a sword in my bones  mine enemies reproach me  while they say daily unto me  where  is  thy god

psalm 44
1 	to the chief musician for the sons of korah  maschil  we have heard with our ears  o god  our fathers have told us   what  work thou didst in their days  in the times of old  
2	 how  thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand  and plantedst them   how  thou didst afflict the people  and cast them out  
3	for they got not the land in possession by their own sword  neither did their own arm save them  but thy right hand  and thine arm  and the light of thy countenance  because thou hadst a favour unto them  
4	thou art my king  o god  command deliverances for jacob  
5	through thee will we push down our enemies  through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us  
6	for i will not trust in my bow  neither shall my sword save me  
7	but thou hast saved us from our enemies  and hast put them to shame that hated us  
8	in god we boast all the day long  and praise thy name for ever  selah  
9 	but thou hast cast off  and put us to shame  and goest not forth with our armies  
10	thou makest us to turn back from the enemy  and they which hate us spoil for themselves  
11	thou hast given us like sheep  appointed  for meat  and hast scattered us among the heathen  
12	thou sellest thy people for nought  and dost not increase  thy wealth  by their price  
13	thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours  a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us  
14	thou makest us a byword among the heathen  a shaking of the head among the people  
15	my confusion  is  continually before me  and the shame of my face hath covered me  
16	for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth  by reason of the enemy and avenger  
17 	all this is come upon us  yet have we not forgotten thee  neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant  
18	our heart is not turned back  neither have our steps declined from thy way  
19	though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons  and covered us with the shadow of death  
20	if we have forgotten the name of our god  or stretched out our hands to a strange god  
21	shall not god search this out  for he knoweth the secrets of the heart  
22	yea  for thy sake are we killed all the day long  we are counted as sheep for the slaughter  
23	awake  why sleepest thou  o lord  arise  cast  us  not off for ever  
24	wherefore hidest thou thy face   and  forgettest our affliction and our oppression  
25	for our soul is bowed down to the dust  our belly cleaveth unto the earth  
26	arise for our help  and redeem us for thy mercies  sake

8	i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings   to have been  continually before me  
9	i will take no bullock out of thy house   nor  he goats out of thy folds

15	and call upon me in the day of trouble  i will deliver thee  and thou shalt glorify me  
16 	but unto the wicked god saith  what hast thou to do to declare my statutes  or  that  thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth  
17	seeing thou hatest instruction  and castest my words behind thee  
18	when thou sawest a thief  then thou consentedst with him  and hast been partaker with adulterers  
19	thou givest thy mouth to evil  and thy tongue frameth deceit  
20	thou sittest  and  speakest against thy brother  thou slanderest thine own mother s son  
21	these  things  hast thou done  and i kept silence  thou thoughtest that i was altogether  such an one  as thyself   but  i will reprove thee  and set  them  in order before thine eyes  
22	now consider this  ye that forget god  lest i tear  you  in pieces  and  there be  none to deliver

15	o lord  open thou my lips  and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise  
16	for thou desirest not sacrifice  else would i give  it   thou delightest not in burnt offering  
17	the sacrifices of god  are  a broken spirit  a broken and a contrite heart  o god  thou wilt not despise  
18	do good in thy good pleasure unto zion  build thou the walls of jerusalem

2	thy tongue deviseth mischiefs  like a sharp razor  working deceitfully  
3	thou lovest evil more than good   and  lying rather than to speak righteousness  selah  
4	thou lovest all devouring words  o  thou  deceitful tongue  
5	god shall likewise destroy thee for ever  he shall take thee away  and pluck thee out of  thy  dwelling place  and root thee out of the land of the living  selah  
6 	the righteous also shall see  and fear  and shall laugh at him

psalm 55
1 	to the chief musician on neginoth  maschil   a psalm  of david  give ear to my prayer  o god  and hide not thyself from my supplication  
2	attend unto me  and hear me  i mourn in my complaint  and make a noise  
3	because of the voice of the enemy  because of the oppression of the wicked  for they cast iniquity upon me  and in wrath they hate me  
4	my heart is sore pained within me  and the terrors of death are fallen upon me  
5	fearfulness and trembling are come upon me  and horror hath overwhelmed me  
6	and i said  oh that i had wings like a dove   for then  would i fly away  and be at rest  
7	lo   then  would i wander far off   and  remain in the wilderness  selah  
8	i would hasten my escape from the windy storm  and  tempest  
9 	destroy  o lord   and  divide their tongues  for i have seen violence and strife in the city  
10	day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof  mischief also and sorrow  are  in the midst of it  
11	wickedness  is  in the midst thereof  deceit and guile depart not from her streets  
12	for  it was  not an enemy  that  reproached me  then i could have borne  it   neither  was it  he that hated me  that  did magnify  himself  against me  then i would have hid myself from him  
13	but  it was  thou  a man mine equal  my guide  and mine acquaintance  
14	we took sweet counsel together   and  walked unto the house of god in company  
15	let death seize upon them   and  let them go down quick into hell  for wickedness  is  in their dwellings   and  among them  
16 	as for me  i will call upon god  and the lord shall save me  
17	evening  and morning  and at noon  will i pray  and cry aloud  and he shall hear my voice  
18	he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle  that was  against me  for there were many with me  
19	god shall hear  and afflict them  even he that abideth of old  selah  because they have no changes  therefore they fear not god  
20	he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him  he hath broken his covenant  
21	 the words  of his mouth were smoother than butter  but war  was  in his heart  his words were softer than oil  yet  were  they drawn swords  
22	cast thy burden upon the lord  and he shall sustain thee  he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved  
23	but thou  o god  shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction  bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days  but i will trust in thee

8 	thou tellest my wanderings  put thou my tears into thy bottle   are they  not in thy book  
9	when i cry  unto thee   then shall mine enemies turn back  this i know  for god  is  for me  
10	in god will i praise  his  word  in the lord will i praise  his  word  
11	in god have i put my trust  i will not be afraid what man can do unto me  
12	thy vows  are  upon me  o god  i will render praises unto thee  
13	for thou hast delivered my soul from death   wilt  not  thou deliver  my feet from falling  that i may walk before god in the light of the living

2	yea  in heart ye work wickedness  ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth  
3	the wicked are estranged from the womb  they go astray as soon as they be born  speaking lies  
4	their poison  is  like the poison of a serpent   they are  like the deaf adder  that  stoppeth her ear  
5	which will not hearken to the voice of charmers  charming never so wisely  
6 	break their teeth  o god  in their mouth  break out the great teeth of the young lions  o lord  
7	let them melt away as waters  which  run continually   when  he bendeth  his bow to shoot  his arrows  let them be as cut in pieces  
8	as a snail  which  melteth  let  every one of them  pass away   like  the untimely birth of a woman   that  they may not see the sun  
9	before your pots can feel the thorns  he shall take them away as with a whirlwind  both living  and in  his  wrath  
10	the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance  he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked  
11	so that a man shall say  verily  there is  a reward for the righteous  verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth

psalm 69
1 	to the chief musician upon shoshannim   a psalm  of david  save me  o god  for the waters are come in unto  my  soul  
2	i sink in deep mire  where  there is  no standing  i am come into deep waters  where the floods overflow me  
3	i am weary of my crying  my throat is dried  mine eyes fail while i wait for my god  
4	they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head  they that would destroy me   being  mine enemies wrongfully  are mighty  then i restored  that  which i took not away  
5	o god  thou knowest my foolishness  and my sins are not hid from thee  
6	let not them that wait on thee  o lord god of hosts  be ashamed for my sake  let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake  o god of israel  
7	because for thy sake i have borne reproach  shame hath covered my face  
8	i am become a stranger unto my brethren  and an alien unto my mother s children  
9	for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up  and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me  
10	when i wept   and chastened  my soul with fasting  that was to my reproach  
11	i made sackcloth also my garment  and i became a proverb to them  
12	they that sit in the gate speak against me  and i  was  the song of the drunkards

21	they gave me also gall for my meat  and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  
22 	let their table become a snare before them  and  that which should have been  for  their  welfare   let it become  a trap

24	pour out thine indignation upon them  and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them

26	for they persecute  him  whom thou hast smitten  and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded

30 	i will praise the name of god with a song  and will magnify him with thanksgiving  
31	 this  also shall please the lord better than an ox  or  bullock that hath horns and hoofs  
32	the humble shall see  this  and  be glad  and your heart shall live that seek god  
33	for the lord heareth the poor  and despiseth not his prisoners  
34	let the heaven and earth praise him  the seas  and every thing that moveth therein  
35	for god will save zion  and will build the cities of judah  that they may dwell there  and have it in possession  
36	the seed also of his servants shall inherit it  and they that love his name shall dwell therein

1 	to the chief musician   a psalm  of david  to bring to remembrance   make haste   o god  to deliver me  make haste to help me  o lord  
2	let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul  let them be turned backward  and put to confusion  that desire my hurt  
3	let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say  aha  aha

3	be thou my strong habitation  whereunto i may continually resort  thou hast given commandment to save me  for thou  art  my rock and my fortress  
4	deliver me  o my god  out of the hand of the wicked  out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man

15	my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness  and  thy salvation all the day  for i know not the numbers  thereof   
16	i will go in the strength of the lord god  i will make mention of thy righteousness   even  of thine only  
17	o god  thou hast taught me from my youth  and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works  
18	now also when i am old and grayheaded  o god  forsake me not  until i have shewed thy strength unto  this  generation   and  thy power to every one  that  is to come  
19	thy righteousness also  o god   is  very high  who hast done great things  o god  who  is  like unto thee  
20	 thou   which hast shewed me great and sore troubles  shalt quicken me again  and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth  
21	thou shalt increase my greatness  and comfort me on every side  
22	i will also praise thee with the psaltery   even  thy truth  o my god  unto thee will i sing with the harp  o thou holy one of israel  
23	my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee  and my soul  which thou hast redeemed

psalm 73
1 	a psalm of asaph  truly god  is  good to israel   even  to such as are of a clean heart  
2	but as for me  my feet were almost gone  my steps had well nigh slipped  
3	for i was envious at the foolish   when  i saw the prosperity of the wicked  
4	for  there are  no bands in their death  but their strength  is  firm  
5	they  are  not in trouble  as other  men  neither are they plagued like  other  men  
6	therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain  violence covereth them  as  a garment  
7	their eyes stand out with fatness  they have more than heart could wish  
8	they are corrupt  and speak wickedly  concerning  oppression  they speak loftily  
9	they set their mouth against the heavens  and their tongue walketh through the earth  
10	therefore his people return hither  and waters of a full  cup  are wrung out to them  
11	and they say  how doth god know  and is there knowledge in the most high  
12	behold  these  are  the ungodly  who prosper in the world  they increase  in  riches  
13	verily i have cleansed my heart  in  vain  and washed my hands in innocency  
14	for all the day long have i been plagued  and chastened every morning  
15 	if i say  i will speak thus  behold  i should offend  against  the generation of thy children  
16	when i thought to know this  it  was  too painful for me  
17	until i went into the sanctuary of god   then  understood i their end  
18	surely thou didst set them in slippery places  thou castedst them down into destruction  
19	how are they  brought  into desolation  as in a moment  they are utterly consumed with terrors  
20	as a dream when  one  awaketh   so   o lord  when thou awakest  thou shalt despise their image  
21 	thus my heart was grieved  and i was pricked in my reins  
22	so foolish  was  i  and ignorant  i was  as  a beast before thee  
23	nevertheless i  am  continually with thee  thou hast holden  me  by my right hand  
24	thou shalt guide me with thy counsel  and afterward receive me  to  glory  
25	whom have i in heaven  but thee   and  there is  none upon earth  that  i desire beside thee  
26	my flesh and my heart faileth   but  god  is  the strength of my heart  and my portion for ever  
27	for  lo  they that are far from thee shall perish  thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee  
28	but  it is  good for me to draw near to god  i have put my trust in the lord god  that i may declare all thy works  
psalm 74
1 	maschil of asaph  o god  why hast thou cast  us  off for ever   why  doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture  
2	remember thy congregation   which  thou hast purchased of old  the rod of thine inheritance   which  thou hast redeemed  this mount zion  wherein thou hast dwelt  
3	lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations   even  all  that  the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary  
4	thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations  they set up their ensigns  for  signs  
5	 a man  was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees  
6	but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers  
7	they have cast fire into thy sanctuary  they have defiled  by casting down  the dwelling place of thy name to the ground  
8	they said in their hearts  let us destroy them together  they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land  
9	we see not our signs   there is  no more any prophet  neither  is there  among us any that knoweth how long  
10	o god  how long shall the adversary reproach  shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever  
11	why withdrawest thou thy hand  even thy right hand  pluck  it  out of thy bosom  
12 	for god  is  my king of old  working salvation in the midst of the earth  
13	thou didst divide the sea by thy strength  thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters  
14	thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces   and  gavest him  to be  meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness  
15	thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood  thou driedst up mighty rivers  
16	the day  is  thine  the night also  is  thine  thou hast prepared the light and the sun  
17	thou hast set all the borders of the earth  thou hast made summer and winter  
18 	remember this   that  the enemy hath reproached  o lord  and  that  the foolish people have blasphemed thy name  
19	o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude  of the wicked   forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever  
20	have respect unto the covenant  for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty  
21	o let not the oppressed return ashamed  let the poor and needy praise thy name  
22	arise  o god  plead thine own cause  remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily  
23	forget not the voice of thine enemies  the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually  
psalm 75
1 	to the chief musician  altaschith  a psalm  or  song of asaph  unto thee  o god  do we give thanks   unto thee  do we give thanks  for  that  thy name is near thy wondrous works declare  
2	when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly  
3	the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved  i bear up the pillars of it  selah  
4	i said unto the fools  deal not foolishly  and to the wicked  lift not up the horn  
5	lift not up your horn on high  speak  not with  a stiff neck  
6 	for promotion  cometh  neither from the east  nor from the west  nor from the south  
7	but god  is  the judge  he putteth down one  and setteth up another  
8	for in the hand of the lord  there is  a cup  and the wine is red  it is full of mixture  and he poureth out of the same  but the dregs thereof  all the wicked of the earth shall wring  them  out   and  drink  them   
9	but i will declare for ever  i will sing praises to the god of jacob  
10	all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off   but  the horns of the righteous shall be exalted  
psalm 76
1 	to the chief musician on neginoth  a psalm  or  song of asaph  in judah  is  god known  his name  is  great in israel  
2	in salem also is his tabernacle  and his dwelling place in zion  
3	there brake he the arrows of the bow  the shield  and the sword  and the battle  selah  
4	thou  art  more glorious  and  excellent than the mountains of prey  
5	the stouthearted are spoiled  they have slept their sleep  and none of the men of might have found their hands  
6	at thy rebuke  o god of jacob  both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep  
7 	thou   even  thou   art  to be feared  and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry  
8	thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven  the earth feared  and was still  
9	when god arose to judgment  to save all the meek of the earth  selah  
10	surely the wrath of man shall praise thee  the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain  
11	vow  and pay unto the lord your god  let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared  
12	he shall cut off the spirit of princes   he is  terrible to the kings of the earth  
psalm 77
1 	to the chief musician  to jeduthun  a psalm of asaph  i cried unto god with my voice   even  unto god with my voice  and he gave ear unto me  
2	in the day of my trouble i sought the lord  my sore ran in the night  and ceased not  my soul refused to be comforted  
3	i remembered god  and was troubled  i complained  and my spirit was overwhelmed  selah  
4	thou holdest mine eyes waking  i am so troubled that i cannot speak  
5	i have considered the days of old  the years of ancient times  
6	i call to remembrance my song in the night  i commune with mine own heart  and my spirit made diligent search  
7	will the lord cast off for ever  and will he be favourable no more  
8	is his mercy clean gone for ever  doth  his  promise fail for evermore  
9	hath god forgotten to be gracious  hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies  selah  
10	and i said  this  is  my infirmity   but i will remember  the years of the right hand of the most high  
11 	i will remember the works of the lord  surely i will remember thy wonders of old  
12	i will meditate also of all thy work  and talk of thy doings  
13	thy way  o god   is  in the sanctuary  who  is so  great a god as  our  god  
14	thou  art  the god that doest wonders  thou hast declared thy strength among the people  
15	thou hast with  thine  arm redeemed thy people  the sons of jacob and joseph  selah  
16	the waters saw thee  o god  the waters saw thee  they were afraid  the depths also were troubled  
17	the clouds poured out water  the skies sent out a sound  thine arrows also went abroad  
18	the voice of thy thunder  was  in the heaven  the lightnings lightened the world  the earth trembled and shook  
19	thy way  is  in the sea  and thy path in the great waters  and thy footsteps are not known  
20	thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron  
psalm 78
1 	maschil of asaph  give ear  o my people   to  my law  incline your ears to the words of my mouth  
2	i will open my mouth in a parable  i will utter dark sayings of old  
3	which we have heard and known  and our fathers have told us  
4	we will not hide  them  from their children  shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord  and his strength  and his wonderful works that he hath done  
5	for he established a testimony in jacob  and appointed a law in israel  which he commanded our fathers  that they should make them known to their children  
6	that the generation to come might know  them  even  the children  which  should be born   who  should arise and declare  them  to their children  
7	that they might set their hope in god  and not forget the works of god  but keep his commandments  
8	and might not be as their fathers  a stubborn and rebellious generation  a generation  that  set not their heart aright  and whose spirit was not stedfast with god  
9 	the children of ephraim   being  armed   and  carrying bows  turned back in the day of battle  
10	they kept not the covenant of god  and refused to walk in his law  
11	and forgat his works  and his wonders that he had shewed them  
12	marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers  in the land of egypt   in  the field of zoan  
13	he divided the sea  and caused them to pass through  and he made the waters to stand as an heap  
14	in the daytime also he led them with a cloud  and all the night with a light of fire  
15	he clave the rocks in the wilderness  and gave  them  drink as  out of  the great depths  
16	he brought streams also out of the rock  and caused waters to run down like rivers  
17	and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness  
18	and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust  
19	yea  they spake against god  they said  can god furnish a table in the wilderness  
20	behold  he smote the rock  that the waters gushed out  and the streams overflowed  can he give bread also  can he provide flesh for his people  
21	therefore the lord heard  this   and was wroth  so a fire was kindled against jacob  and anger also came up against israel  
22	because they believed not in god  and trusted not in his salvation  
23	though he had commanded the clouds from above  and opened the doors of heaven  
24	and had rained down manna upon them to eat  and had given them of the corn of heaven  
25	man did eat angels  food  he sent them meat to the full  
26	he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven  and by his power he brought in the south wind  
27	he rained flesh also upon them as dust  and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea  
28	and he let  it  fall in the midst of their camp  round about their habitations  
29	so they did eat  and were well filled  for he gave them their own desire  
30	they were not estranged from their lust  but while their meat  was  yet in their mouths  
31	the wrath of god came upon them  and slew the fattest of them  and smote down the chosen  men  of israel  
32	for all this they sinned still  and believed not for his wondrous works  
33	therefore their days did he consume in vanity  and their years in trouble  
34	when he slew them  then they sought him  and they returned and enquired early after god  
35	and they remembered that god  was  their rock  and the high god their redeemer  
36	nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth  and they lied unto him with their tongues  
37	for their heart was not right with him  neither were they stedfast in his covenant  
38	but he   being  full of compassion  forgave  their  iniquity  and destroyed  them  not  yea  many a time turned he his anger away  and did not stir up all his wrath  
39	for he remembered that they  were but  flesh  a wind that passeth away  and cometh not again  
40 	how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness   and  grieve him in the desert  
41	yea  they turned back and tempted god  and limited the holy one of israel  
42	they remembered not his hand   nor  the day when he delivered them from the enemy  
43	how he had wrought his signs in egypt  and his wonders in the field of zoan  
44	and had turned their rivers into blood  and their floods  that they could not drink  
45	he sent divers sorts of flies among them  which devoured them  and frogs  which destroyed them  
46	he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller  and their labour unto the locust  
47	he destroyed their vines with hail  and their sycomore trees with frost  
48	he gave up their cattle also to the hail  and their flocks to hot thunderbolts  
49	he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger  wrath  and indignation  and trouble  by sending evil angels  among them   
50	he made a way to his anger  he spared not their soul from death  but gave their life over to the pestilence  
51	and smote all the firstborn in egypt  the chief of  their  strength in the tabernacles of ham  
52	but made his own people to go forth like sheep  and guided them in the wilderness like a flock  
53	and he led them on safely  so that they feared not  but the sea overwhelmed their enemies  
54	and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary   even to  this mountain   which  his right hand had purchased  
55	he cast out the heathen also before them  and divided them an inheritance by line  and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents  
56	yet they tempted and provoked the most high god  and kept not his testimonies  
57	but turned back  and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers  they were turned aside like a deceitful bow  
58	for they provoked him to anger with their high places  and moved him to jealousy with their graven images  
59	when god heard  this   he was wroth  and greatly abhorred israel  
60	so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh  the tent  which  he placed among men  
61	and delivered his strength into captivity  and his glory into the enemy s hand  
62	he gave his people over also unto the sword  and was wroth with his inheritance  
63	the fire consumed their young men  and their maidens were not given to marriage  
64	their priests fell by the sword  and their widows made no lamentation  
65	then the lord awaked as one out of sleep   and  like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine  
66	and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts  he put them to a perpetual reproach  
67	moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph  and chose not the tribe of ephraim  
68	but chose the tribe of judah  the mount zion which he loved  
69	and he built his sanctuary like high  palaces   like the earth which he hath established for ever  
70	he chose david also his servant  and took him from the sheepfolds  
71	from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people  and israel his inheritance  
72	so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart  and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands  
psalm 79
1 	a psalm of asaph  o god  the heathen are come into thine inheritance  thy holy temple have they defiled  they have laid jerusalem on heaps  
2	the dead bodies of thy servants have they given  to be  meat unto the fowls of the heaven  the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth  
3	their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem  and  there was  none to bury  them   
4	we are become a reproach to our neighbours  a scorn and derision to them that are round about us  
5	how long  lord  wilt thou be angry for ever  shall thy jealousy burn like fire  
6 	pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee  and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name  
7	for they have devoured jacob  and laid waste his dwelling place  
8	o remember not against us former iniquities  let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us  for we are brought very low  
9	help us  o god of our salvation  for the glory of thy name  and deliver us  and purge away our sins  for thy name s sake  
10	wherefore should the heathen say  where  is  their god  let him be known among the heathen in our sight  by  the revenging of the blood of thy servants  which is  shed  
11	let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee  according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die  
12	and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach  wherewith they have reproached thee  o lord  
13	so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever  we will shew forth thy praise to all generations  
psalm 80

3	turn us again  o god  and cause thy face to shine  and we shall be saved  
4	o lord god of hosts  how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people

7	turn us again  o god of hosts  and cause thy face to shine  and we shall be saved  
8 	thou hast brought a vine out of egypt  thou hast cast out the heathen  and planted it  
9	thou preparedst  room  before it  and didst cause it to take deep root  and it filled the land  
10	the hills were covered with the shadow of it  and the boughs thereof  were like  the goodly cedars  
11	she sent out her boughs unto the sea  and her branches unto the river  
12	why hast thou  then  broken down her hedges  so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her  
13	the boar out of the wood doth waste it  and the wild beast of the field doth devour it  
14	return  we beseech thee  o god of hosts  look down from heaven  and behold  and visit this vine  
15	and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted  and the branch  that  thou madest strong for thyself  
16	 it is  burned with fire   it is  cut down  they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance  
17	let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand  upon the son of man  whom  thou madest strong for thyself

3	blow up the trumpet in the new moon  in the time appointed  on our solemn feast day

5	this he ordained in joseph  for  a testimony  when he went out through the land of egypt   where  i heard a language  that  i understood not  
6	i removed his shoulder from the burden  his hands were delivered from the pots

4	enter into his gates with thanksgiving   and  into his courts with praise  be thankful unto him   and  bless his name  
5	for the lord  is  good  his mercy  is  everlasting  and his truth  endureth  to all generations  
psalm 101
1 	a psalm of david  i will sing of mercy and judgment  unto thee  o lord  will i sing  
2	i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way  o when wilt thou come unto me  i will walk within my house with a perfect heart  
3	i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes  i hate the work of them that turn aside   it  shall not cleave to me  
4	a froward heart shall depart from me  i will not know a wicked  person   
5	whoso privily slandereth his neighbour  him will i cut off  him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer  
6	mine eyes  shall be  upon the faithful of the land  that they may dwell with me  he that walketh in a perfect way  he shall serve me  
7	he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house  he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight  
8	i will early destroy all the wicked of the land  that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord  
psalm 102
1 	a prayer of the afflicted  when he is overwhelmed  and poureth out his complaint before the lord  hear my prayer  o lord  and let my cry come unto thee  
2	hide not thy face from me in the day  when  i am in trouble  incline thine ear unto me  in the day  when  i call answer me speedily  
3	for my days are consumed like smoke  and my bones are burned as an hearth  
4	my heart is smitten  and withered like grass  so that i forget to eat my bread  
5	by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin  
6	i am like a pelican of the wilderness  i am like an owl of the desert  
7	i watch  and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top  
8	mine enemies reproach me all the day   and  they that are mad against me are sworn against me  
9	for i have eaten ashes like bread  and mingled my drink with weeping  
10	because of thine indignation and thy wrath  for thou hast lifted me up  and cast me down  
11	my days  are  like a shadow that declineth  and i am withered like grass  
12 	but thou  o lord  shalt endure for ever  and thy remembrance unto all generations  
13	thou shalt arise   and  have mercy upon zion  for the time to favour her  yea  the set time  is come  
14	for thy servants take pleasure in her stones  and favour the dust thereof  
15	so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord  and all the kings of the earth thy glory  
16	when the lord shall build up zion  he shall appear in his glory  
17	he will regard the prayer of the destitute  and not despise their prayer  
18	this shall be written for the generation to come  and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord  
19	for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary  from heaven did the lord behold the earth  
20	to hear the groaning of the prisoner  to loose those that are appointed to death  
21	to declare the name of the lord in zion  and his praise in jerusalem  
22	when the people are gathered together  and the kingdoms  to serve the lord  
23 	he weakened my strength in the way  he shortened my days  
24	i said  o my god  take me not away in the midst of my days  thy years  are  throughout all generations  
25	of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth  and the heavens  are  the work of thy hands  
26	they shall perish  but thou shalt endure  yea  all of them shall wax old like a garment  as a vesture shalt thou change them  and they shall be changed  
27	but thou  art  the same  and thy years shall have no end  
28	the children of thy servants shall continue  and their seed shall be established before thee  
psalm 103
1 	 a psalm  of david  bless the lord  o my soul  and all that is within me   bless  his holy name  
2	bless the lord  o my soul  and forget not all his benefits  
3	who forgiveth all thine iniquities  who healeth all thy diseases  
4	who redeemeth thy life from destruction  who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies  
5	who satisfieth thy mouth with good  things  so that  thy youth is renewed like the eagle s  
6 	the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed  
7	he made known his ways unto moses  his acts unto the children of israel  
8	the lord  is  merciful and gracious  slow to anger  and plenteous in mercy  
9	he will not always chide  neither will he keep  his anger  for ever  
10	he hath not dealt with us after our sins  nor rewarded us according to our iniquities  
11	for as the heaven is high above the earth   so  great is his mercy toward them that fear him  
12	as far as the east is from the west   so  far hath he removed our transgressions from us  
13	like as a father pitieth  his  children   so  the lord pitieth them that fear him  
14	for he knoweth our frame  he remembereth that we  are  dust  
15	 as for  man  his days  are  as grass  as a flower of the field  so he flourisheth  
16	for the wind passeth over it  and it is gone  and the place thereof shall know it no more  
17	but the mercy of the lord  is  from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him  and his righteousness unto children s children  
18	to such as keep his covenant  and to those that remember his commandments to do them  
19 	the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens  and his kingdom ruleth over all  
20	bless the lord  ye his angels  that excel in strength  that do his commandments  hearkening unto the voice of his word  
21	bless ye the lord  all  ye  his hosts   ye  ministers of his  that do his pleasure  
22	bless the lord  all his works in all places of his dominion  bless the lord  o my soul  
psalm 104
1 	bless the lord  o my soul  o lord my god  thou art very great  thou art clothed with honour and majesty  
2	who coverest  thyself  with light as  with  a garment  who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain  
3	who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters  who maketh the clouds his chariot  who walketh upon the wings of the wind  
4	who maketh his angels spirits  his ministers a flaming fire  
5	 who  laid the foundations of the earth   that  it should not be removed for ever  
6	thou coveredst it with the deep as  with  a garment  the waters stood above the mountains  
7	at thy rebuke they fled  at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away  
8	they go up by the mountains  they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them  
9	thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over  that they turn not again to cover the earth  
10 	he sendeth the springs into the valleys   which  run among the hills  
11	they give drink to every beast of the field  the wild asses quench their thirst  
12	by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation   which  sing among the branches  
13	he watereth the hills from his chambers  the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works  
14	he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle  and herb for the service of man  that he may bring forth food out of the earth  
15	and wine  that  maketh glad the heart of man   and  oil to make  his  face to shine  and bread  which  strengtheneth man s heart  
16	the trees of the lord are full  of sap   the cedars of lebanon  which he hath planted  
17	where the birds make their nests   as for  the stork  the fir trees  are  her house  
18	the high hills  are  a refuge for the wild goats   and  the rocks for the conies  
19 	he appointed the moon for seasons  the sun knoweth his going down  
20	thou makest darkness  and it is night  wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep  forth   
21	the young lions roar after their prey  and seek their meat from god  
22	the sun ariseth  they gather themselves together  and lay them down in their dens  
23	man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening  
24	o lord  how manifold are thy works  in wisdom hast thou made them all  the earth is full of thy riches  
25	 so is  this great and wide sea  wherein  are  things creeping innumerable  both small and great beasts  
26	there go the ships   there is  that leviathan   whom  thou hast made to play therein  
27	these wait all upon thee  that thou mayest give  them  their meat in due season  
28	 that  thou givest them they gather  thou openest thine hand  they are filled with good  
29	thou hidest thy face  they are troubled  thou takest away their breath  they die  and return to their dust  
30	thou sendest forth thy spirit  they are created  and thou renewest the face of the earth  
31 	the glory of the lord shall endure for ever  the lord shall rejoice in his works  
32	he looketh on the earth  and it trembleth  he toucheth the hills  and they smoke  
33	i will sing unto the lord as long as i live  i will sing praise to my god while i have my being

psalm 105
1 	o give thanks unto the lord  call upon his name  make known his deeds among the people  
2	sing unto him  sing psalms unto him  talk ye of all his wondrous works  
3	glory ye in his holy name  let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord  
4	seek the lord  and his strength  seek his face evermore  
5	remember his marvellous works that he hath done  his wonders  and the judgments of his mouth  
6	o ye seed of abraham his servant  ye children of jacob his chosen  
7	he  is  the lord our god  his judgments  are  in all the earth  
8 	he hath remembered his covenant for ever  the word  which  he commanded to a thousand generations  
9	which  covenant  he made with abraham  and his oath unto isaac  
10	and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law   and  to israel  for  an everlasting covenant  
11	saying  unto thee will i give the land of canaan  the lot of your inheritance  
12	when they were  but  a few men in number  yea  very few  and strangers in it  
13	when they went from one nation to another  from  one  kingdom to another people  
14	he suffered no man to do them wrong  yea  he reproved kings for their sakes  
15	 saying   touch not mine anointed  and do my prophets no harm  
16	moreover he called for a famine upon the land  he brake the whole staff of bread  
17	he sent a man before them   even  joseph   who  was sold for a servant  
18	whose feet they hurt with fetters  he was laid in iron  
19	until the time that his word came  the word of the lord tried him  
20	the king sent and loosed him   even  the ruler of the people  and let him go free  
21	he made him lord of his house  and ruler of all his substance  
22	to bind his princes at his pleasure  and teach his senators wisdom  
23	israel also came into egypt  and jacob sojourned in the land of ham  
24	and he increased his people greatly  and made them stronger than their enemies  
25 	he turned their heart to hate his people  to deal subtilly with his servants  
26	he sent moses his servant   and  aaron whom he had chosen  
27	they shewed his signs among them  and wonders in the land of ham  
28	he sent darkness  and made it dark  and they rebelled not against his word  
29	he turned their waters into blood  and slew their fish  
30	their land brought forth frogs in abundance  in the chambers of their kings  
31	he spake  and there came divers sorts of flies   and  lice in all their coasts  
32	he gave them hail for rain   and  flaming fire in their land  
33	he smote their vines also and their fig trees  and brake the trees of their coasts  
34	he spake  and the locusts came  and caterpillers  and that without number  
35	and did eat up all the herbs in their land  and devoured the fruit of their ground  
36	he smote also all the firstborn in their land  the chief of all their strength  
37	he brought them forth also with silver and gold  and  there was  not one feeble  person  among their tribes  
38	egypt was glad when they departed  for the fear of them fell upon them  
39	he spread a cloud for a covering  and fire to give light in the night  
40	 the people  asked  and he brought quails  and satisfied them with the bread of heaven  
41	he opened the rock  and the waters gushed out  they ran in the dry places  like  a river  
42	for he remembered his holy promise   and  abraham his servant  
43	and he brought forth his people with joy   and  his chosen with gladness  
44	and gave them the lands of the heathen  and they inherited the labour of the people  
45	that they might observe his statutes  and keep his laws  praise ye the lord  
psalm 106
1 	praise ye the lord  o give thanks unto the lord  for  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever  
2	who can utter the mighty acts of the lord   who  can shew forth all his praise  
3	blessed  are  they that keep judgment   and  he that doeth righteousness at all times  
4	remember me  o lord  with the favour  that thou bearest unto  thy people  o visit me with thy salvation  
5	that i may see the good of thy chosen  that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation  that i may glory with thine inheritance  
6 	we have sinned with our fathers  we have committed iniquity  we have done wickedly  
7	our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt  they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies  but provoked  him  at the sea   even  at the red sea  
8	nevertheless he saved them for his name s sake  that he might make his mighty power to be known  
9	he rebuked the red sea also  and it was dried up  so he led them through the depths  as through the wilderness  
10	and he saved them from the hand of him that hated  them   and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy  
11	and the waters covered their enemies  there was not one of them left  
12	then believed they his words  they sang his praise  
13 	they soon forgat his works  they waited not for his counsel  
14	but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness  and tempted god in the desert  
15	and he gave them their request  but sent leanness into their soul  
16	they envied moses also in the camp   and  aaron the saint of the lord  
17	the earth opened and swallowed up dathan  and covered the company of abiram  
18	and a fire was kindled in their company  the flame burned up the wicked  
19	they made a calf in horeb  and worshipped the molten image  
20	thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass  
21	they forgat god their saviour  which had done great things in egypt  
22	wondrous works in the land of ham   and  terrible things by the red sea  
23	therefore he said that he would destroy them  had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach  to turn away his wrath  lest he should destroy  them   
24	yea  they despised the pleasant land  they believed not his word  
25	but murmured in their tents   and  hearkened not unto the voice of the lord  
26	therefore he lifted up his hand against them  to overthrow them in the wilderness  
27	to overthrow their seed also among the nations  and to scatter them in the lands  
28	they joined themselves also unto baalpeor  and ate the sacrifices of the dead  
29	thus they provoked  him  to anger with their inventions  and the plague brake in upon them  
30	then stood up phinehas  and executed judgment  and  so  the plague was stayed  
31	and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore  
32	they angered  him  also at the waters of strife  so that it went ill with moses for their sakes  
33	because they provoked his spirit  so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips  
34 	they did not destroy the nations  concerning whom the lord commanded them  
35	but were mingled among the heathen  and learned their works  
36	and they served their idols  which were a snare unto them  
37	yea  they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils  
38	and shed innocent blood   even  the blood of their sons and of their daughters  whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan  and the land was polluted with blood  
39	thus were they defiled with their own works  and went a whoring with their own inventions  
40	therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people  insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance  
41	and he gave them into the hand of the heathen  and they that hated them ruled over them  
42	their enemies also oppressed them  and they were brought into subjection under their hand  
43	many times did he deliver them  but they provoked  him  with their counsel  and were brought low for their iniquity  
44	nevertheless he regarded their affliction  when he heard their cry  
45	and he remembered for them his covenant  and repented according to the multitude of his mercies  
46	he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives  
47	save us  o lord our god  and gather us from among the heathen  to give thanks unto thy holy name   and  to triumph in thy praise  
48	blessed  be  the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting  and let all the people say  amen  praise ye the lord  
psalm 107
1 	o give thanks unto the lord  for  he is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever  
2	let the redeemed of the lord say  so   whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy  
3	and gathered them out of the lands  from the east  and from the west  from the north  and from the south  
4	they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way  they found no city to dwell in  
5	hungry and thirsty  their soul fainted in them  
6	then they cried unto the lord in their trouble   and  he delivered them out of their distresses  
7	and he led them forth by the right way  that they might go to a city of habitation  
8	oh that  men  would praise the lord  for  his goodness  and  for  his wonderful works to the children of men  
9	for he satisfieth the longing soul  and filleth the hungry soul with goodness  
10 	such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death   being  bound in affliction and iron  
11	because they rebelled against the words of god  and contemned the counsel of the most high  
12	therefore he brought down their heart with labour  they fell down  and  there was  none to help  
13	then they cried unto the lord in their trouble   and  he saved them out of their distresses  
14	he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death  and brake their bands in sunder  
15	oh that  men  would praise the lord  for  his goodness  and  for  his wonderful works to the children of men  
16	for he hath broken the gates of brass  and cut the bars of iron in sunder  
17 	fools because of their transgression  and because of their iniquities  are afflicted  
18	their soul abhorreth all manner of meat  and they draw near unto the gates of death  
19	then they cry unto the lord in their trouble   and  he saveth them out of their distresses  
20	he sent his word  and healed them  and delivered  them  from their destructions  
21	oh that  men  would praise the lord  for  his goodness  and  for  his wonderful works to the children of men  
22	and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving  and declare his works with rejoicing  
23 	they that go down to the sea in ships  that do business in great waters  
24	these see the works of the lord  and his wonders in the deep  
25	for he commandeth  and raiseth the stormy wind  which lifteth up the waves thereof  
26	they mount up to the heaven  they go down again to the depths  their soul is melted because of trouble  
27	they reel to and fro  and stagger like a drunken man  and are at their wits  end  
28	then they cry unto the lord in their trouble  and he bringeth them out of their distresses  
29	he maketh the storm a calm  so that the waves thereof are still  
30	then are they glad because they be quiet  so he bringeth them unto their desired haven  
31	oh that  men  would praise the lord  for  his goodness  and  for  his wonderful works to the children of men  
32	let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people  and praise him in the assembly of the elders  
33 	he turneth rivers into a wilderness  and the watersprings into dry ground  
34	a fruitful land into barrenness  for the wickedness of them that dwell therein  
35	he turneth the wilderness into a standing water  and dry ground into watersprings  
36	and there he maketh the hungry to dwell  that they may prepare a city for habitation  
37	and sow the fields  and plant vineyards  which may yield fruits of increase  
38	he blesseth them also  so that they are multiplied greatly  and suffereth not their cattle to decrease  
39	again  they are minished and brought low through oppression  affliction  and sorrow  
40	he poureth contempt upon princes  and causeth them to wander in the wilderness   where there is  no way  
41	yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction  and maketh  him  families like a flock  
42	the righteous shall see  it   and rejoice  and all iniquity shall stop her mouth  
43	whoso  is  wise  and will observe these  things   even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord

psalm 109
1 	to the chief musician  a psalm of david  hold not thy peace  o god of my praise  
2	for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me  they have spoken against me with a lying tongue  
3	they compassed me about also with words of hatred  and fought against me without a cause  
4	for my love they are my adversaries  but i  give myself unto  prayer  
5	and they have rewarded me evil for good  and hatred for my love  
6 	set thou a wicked man over him  and let satan stand at his right hand  
7	when he shall be judged  let him be condemned  and let his prayer become sin  
8	let his days be few   and  let another take his office  
9	let his children be fatherless  and his wife a widow  
10	let his children be continually vagabonds  and beg  let them seek  their bread  also out of their desolate places  
11	let the extortioner catch all that he hath  and let the strangers spoil his labour  
12	let there be none to extend mercy unto him  neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children  
13	let his posterity be cut off   and  in the generation following let their name be blotted out  
14	let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord  and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out  
15	let them be before the lord continually  that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth  
16	because that he remembered not to shew mercy  but persecuted the poor and needy man  that he might even slay the broken in heart  
17	as he loved cursing  so let it come unto him  as he delighted not in blessing  so let it be far from him  
18	as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment  so let it come into his bowels like water  and like oil into his bones  
19	let it be unto him as the garment  which  covereth him  and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually  
20	 let  this  be  the reward of mine adversaries from the lord  and of them that speak evil against my soul  
21 	but do thou for me  o god the lord  for thy name s sake  because thy mercy  is  good  deliver thou me  
22	for i  am  poor and needy  and my heart is wounded within me  
23	i am gone like the shadow when it declineth  i am tossed up and down as the locust  
24	my knees are weak through fasting  and my flesh faileth of fatness  
25	i became also a reproach unto them   when  they looked upon me they shaked their heads  
26	help me  o lord my god  o save me according to thy mercy  
27	that they may know that this  is  thy hand   that  thou  lord  hast done it  
28	let them curse  but bless thou  when they arise  let them be ashamed  but let thy servant rejoice  
29	let mine adversaries be clothed with shame  and let them cover themselves with their own confusion  as with a mantle  
30	i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth  yea  i will praise him among the multitude  
31	for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor  to save  him  from those that condemn his soul

3	lo  children  are  an heritage of the lord   and  the fruit of the womb  is his  reward

2	to know wisdom and instruction  to perceive the words of understanding  
3	to receive the instruction of wisdom  justice  and judgment  and equity  
4	to give subtilty to the simple  to the young man knowledge and discretion  
5	a wise  man  will hear  and will increase learning  and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels  
6	to understand a proverb  and the interpretation  the words of the wise  and their dark sayings  
7 	the fear of the lord  is  the beginning of knowledge   but  fools despise wisdom and instruction  
8	my son  hear the instruction of thy father  and forsake not the law of thy mother  
9	for they  shall be  an ornament of grace unto thy head  and chains about thy neck  
10 	my son  if sinners entice thee  consent thou not  
11	if they say  come with us  let us lay wait for blood  let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause  
12	let us swallow them up alive as the grave  and whole  as those that go down into the pit  
13	we shall find all precious substance  we shall fill our houses with spoil  
14	cast in thy lot among us  let us all have one purse  
15	my son  walk not thou in the way with them  refrain thy foot from their path  
16	for their feet run to evil  and make haste to shed blood  
17	surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird  
18	and they lay wait for their  own  blood  they lurk privily for their  own  lives  
19	so  are  the ways of every one that is greedy of gain   which  taketh away the life of the owners thereof  
20 	wisdom crieth without  she uttereth her voice in the streets

23	turn you at my reproof  behold  i will pour out my spirit unto you  i will make known my words unto you  
24	because i have called  and ye refused  i have stretched out my hand  and no man regarded  
25	but ye have set at nought all my counsel  and would none of my reproof  
26	i also will laugh at your calamity  i will mock when your fear cometh  
27	when your fear cometh as desolation  and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind  when distress and anguish cometh upon you  
28	then shall they call upon me  but i will not answer  they shall seek me early  but they shall not find me  
29	for that they hated knowledge  and did not choose the fear of the lord  
30	they would none of my counsel  they despised all my reproof  
31	therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way  and be filled with their own devices  
32	for the turning away of the simple shall slay them  and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them

4	if thou seekest her as silver  and searchest for her as  for  hid treasures

6	for the lord giveth wisdom  out of his mouth  cometh  knowledge and understanding  
7	he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous   he is  a buckler to them that walk uprightly  
8	he keepeth the paths of judgment  and preserveth the way of his saints

10 	when wisdom entereth into thine heart  and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul  
11	discretion shall preserve thee  understanding shall keep thee

14	who rejoice to do evil   and  delight in the frowardness of the wicked

16	to deliver thee from the strange woman   even  from the stranger  which  flattereth with her words  
17	which forsaketh the guide of her youth  and forgetteth the covenant of her god  
18	for her house inclineth unto death  and her paths unto the dead  
19	none that go unto her return again  neither take they hold of the paths of life  
20	that thou mayest walk in the way of good  men   and keep the paths of the righteous

18	she  is  a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her  and happy  is every one  that retaineth her  
19	the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth  by understanding hath he established the heavens  
20	by his knowledge the depths are broken up  and the clouds drop down the dew

proverbs 4
1 	hear  ye children  the instruction of a father  and attend to know understanding

proverbs 5
1 	my son  attend unto my wisdom   and  bow thine ear to my understanding

4	but her end is bitter as wormwood  sharp as a twoedged sword  
5	her feet go down to death  her steps take hold on hell  
6	lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life  her ways are moveable   that  thou canst not know  them   
7	hear me now therefore  o ye children  and depart not from the words of my mouth  
8	remove thy way far from her  and come not nigh the door of her house  
9	lest thou give thine honour unto others  and thy years unto the cruel  
10	lest strangers be filled with thy wealth  and thy labours  be  in the house of a stranger  
11	and thou mourn at the last  when thy flesh and thy body are consumed  
12	and say  how have i hated instruction  and my heart despised reproof  
13	and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers  nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me  
14	i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly  
15 	drink waters out of thine own cistern  and running waters out of thine own well

18	let thy fountain be blessed  and rejoice with the wife of thy youth  
19	 let her be as  the loving hind and pleasant roe  let her breasts satisfy thee at all times  and be thou ravished always with her love

21	for the ways of man  are  before the eyes of the lord  and he pondereth all his goings  
22	his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself  and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins  
23	he shall die without instruction  and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray  
proverbs 6
1 	my son  if thou be surety for thy friend   if  thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger

8	provideth her meat in the summer   and  gathereth her food in the harvest  
9	how long wilt thou sleep  o sluggard  when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep  
10	 yet  a little sleep  a little slumber  a little folding of the hands to sleep  
11	so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth  and thy want as an armed man  
12 	a naughty person  a wicked man  walketh with a froward mouth  
13	he winketh with his eyes  he speaketh with his feet  he teacheth with his fingers  
14	frowardness  is  in his heart  he deviseth mischief continually  he soweth discord

17	a proud look  a lying tongue  and hands that shed innocent blood  
18	an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations  feet that be swift in running to mischief  
19	a false witness  that  speaketh lies  and he that soweth discord among brethren  
20 	my son  keep thy father s commandment  and forsake not the law of thy mother  
21	bind them continually upon thine heart   and  tie them about thy neck  
22	when thou goest  it shall lead thee  when thou sleepest  it shall keep thee  and  when  thou awakest  it shall talk with thee  
23	for the commandment  is  a lamp  and the law  is  light  and reproofs of instruction  are  the way of life  
24	to keep thee from the evil woman  from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman  
25	lust not after her beauty in thine heart  neither let her take thee with her eyelids  
26	for by means of a whorish woman  a man is brought  to a piece of bread  and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life  
27	can a man take fire in his bosom  and his clothes not be burned  
28	can one go upon hot coals  and his feet not be burned  
29	so he that goeth in to his neighbour s wife  whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent  
30	 men  do not despise a thief  if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry  
31	but  if  he be found  he shall restore sevenfold  he shall give all the substance of his house  
32	 but  whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding  he  that  doeth it destroyeth his own soul  
33	a wound and dishonour shall he get  and his reproach shall not be wiped away  
34	for jealousy  is  the rage of a man  therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance  
35	he will not regard any ransom  neither will he rest content  though thou givest many gifts

4	say unto wisdom  thou  art  my sister  and call understanding  thy  kinswoman  
5	that they may keep thee from the strange woman  from the stranger  which  flattereth with her words  
6 	for at the window of my house i looked through my casement  
7	and beheld among the simple ones  i discerned among the youths  a young man void of understanding  
8	passing through the street near her corner  and he went the way to her house  
9	in the twilight  in the evening  in the black and dark night  
10	and  behold  there met him a woman  with  the attire of an harlot  and subtil of heart  
11	 she  is  loud and stubborn  her feet abide not in her house

23	till a dart strike through his liver  as a bird hasteth to the snare  and knoweth not that it  is  for his life  
24 	hearken unto me now therefore  o ye children  and attend to the words of my mouth

ecclesiastes
ecclesiastes 1
1 	the words of the preacher  the son of david  king in jerusalem  
2	vanity of vanities  saith the preacher  vanity of vanities  all  is  vanity  
3	what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun  
4 	 one  generation passeth away  and  another  generation cometh  but the earth abideth for ever  
5	the sun also ariseth  and the sun goeth down  and hasteth to his place where he arose  
6	the wind goeth toward the south  and turneth about unto the north  it whirleth about continually  and the wind returneth again according to his circuits  
7	all the rivers run into the sea  yet the sea  is  not full  unto the place from whence the rivers come  thither they return again  
8	all things  are  full of labour  man cannot utter  it   the eye is not satisfied with seeing  nor the ear filled with hearing  
9 	the thing that hath been  it  is that  which shall be  and that which is done  is  that which shall be done  and  there is  no new  thing  under the sun  
10	is there  any  thing whereof it may be said  see  this  is  new  it hath been already of old time  which was before us  
11	 there is  no remembrance of former  things   neither shall there be  any  remembrance of  things  that are to come with  those  that shall come after  
12 	i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem  
13	and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all  things  that are done under heaven  this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith  
14	i have seen all the works that are done under the sun  and  behold  all  is  vanity and vexation of spirit  
15	 that which is  crooked cannot be made straight  and that which is wanting cannot be numbered  
16	i communed with mine own heart  saying  lo  i am come to great estate  and have gotten more wisdom than all  they  that have been before me in jerusalem  yea  my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge  
17	and i gave my heart to know wisdom  and to know madness and folly  i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit  
18	for in much wisdom  is  much grief  and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow  
ecclesiastes 2
1 	i said in mine heart  go to now  i will prove thee with mirth  therefore enjoy pleasure  and  behold  this also  is  vanity  
2	i said of laughter   it is  mad  and of mirth  what doeth it  
3	i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine  yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom  and to lay hold on folly  till i might see what  was  that good for the sons of men  which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life  
4	i made me great works  i builded me houses  i planted me vineyards  
5	i made me gardens and orchards  and i planted trees in them of all  kind of  fruits  
6	i made me pools of water  to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees  
7	i got  me  servants and maidens  and had servants born in my house  also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me  
8	i gathered me also silver and gold  and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces  i gat me men singers and women singers  and the delights of the sons of men   as  musical instruments  and that of all sorts  
9	so i was great  and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem  also my wisdom remained with me  
10	and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them  i withheld not my heart from any joy  for my heart rejoiced in all my labour  and this was my portion of all my labour  
11	then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought  and on the labour that i had laboured to do  and  behold  all  was  vanity and vexation of spirit  and  there was  no profit under the sun  
12 	and i turned myself to behold wisdom  and madness  and folly  for what  can  the man  do  that cometh after the king   even  that which hath been already done  
13	then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly  as far as light excelleth darkness  
14	the wise man s eyes  are  in his head  but the fool walketh in darkness  and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all  
15	then said i in my heart  as it happeneth to the fool  so it happeneth even to me  and why was i then more wise  then i said in my heart  that this also  is  vanity  
16	for  there is  no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever  seeing that which now  is  in the days to come shall all be forgotten  and how dieth the wise  man   as the fool  
17 	therefore i hated life  because the work that is wrought under the sun  is  grievous unto me  for all  is  vanity and vexation of spirit  
18	yea  i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun  because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me  
19	and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise  man  or a fool  yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured  and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun  this  is  also vanity  
20	therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun  
21	for there is a man whose labour  is  in wisdom  and in knowledge  and in equity  yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it  for  his portion  this also  is  vanity and a great evil  
22	for what hath man of all his labour  and of the vexation of his heart  wherein he hath laboured under the sun  
23	for all his days  are  sorrows  and his travail grief  yea  his heart taketh not rest in the night  this is also vanity  
24	 there is  nothing better for a man   than  that he should eat and drink  and  that  he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour  this also i saw  that it  was  from the hand of god  
25	for who can eat  or who else can hasten  hereunto   more than i  
26	for  god  giveth to a man that  is  good in his sight wisdom  and knowledge  and joy  but to the sinner he giveth travail  to gather and to heap up  that he may give to  him that is  good before god  this also  is  vanity and vexation of spirit  
ecclesiastes 3
1 	to every  thing there is  a season  and a time to every purpose under the heaven  
2	a time to be born  and a time to die  a time to plant  and a time to pluck up  that which is  planted  
3	a time to kill  and a time to heal  a time to break down  and a time to build up  
4	a time to weep  and a time to laugh  a time to mourn  and a time to dance  
5	a time to cast away stones  and a time to gather stones together  a time to embrace  and a time to refrain from embracing  
6	a time to get  and a time to lose  a time to keep  and a time to cast away  
7	a time to rend  and a time to sew  a time to keep silence  and a time to speak  
8	a time to love  and a time to hate  a time of war  and a time of peace  
9	what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth  
10	i have seen the travail  which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it  
11 	he hath made every  thing  beautiful in his time  also he hath set the world in their heart  so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end  
12	i know that  there is  no good in them  but for  a man  to rejoice  and to do good in his life  
13	and also that every man should eat and drink  and enjoy the good of all his labour  it  is  the gift of god  
14	i know that  whatsoever god doeth  it shall be for ever  nothing can be put to it  nor any thing taken from it  and god doeth  it   that  men  should fear before him  
15	that which hath been is now  and that which is to be hath already been  and god requireth that which is past  
16 	and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment   that  wickedness  was  there  and the place of righteousness   that  iniquity  was  there  
17	i said in mine heart  god shall judge the righteous and the wicked  for  there is  a time there for every purpose and for every work  
18	i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men  that god might manifest them  and that they might see that they themselves are beasts  
19	for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts  even one thing befalleth them  as the one dieth  so dieth the other  yea  they have all one breath  so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast  for all  is  vanity  
20	all go unto one place  all are of the dust  and all turn to dust again  
21	who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward  and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth  
22	wherefore i perceive that  there is  nothing better  than that a man should rejoice in his own works  for that  is  his portion  for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him  
ecclesiastes 4
1 	so i returned  and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun  and behold the tears of  such as were  oppressed  and they had no comforter  and on the side of their oppressors  there was  power  but they had no comforter  
2	wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive  
3	yea  better  is he  than both they  which hath not yet been  who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun  
4 	again  i considered all travail  and every right work  that for this a man is envied of his neighbour  this  is  also vanity and vexation of spirit  
5	the fool foldeth his hands together  and eateth his own flesh  
6	better  is  an handful  with  quietness  than both the hands full  with  travail and vexation of spirit  
7 	then i returned  and i saw vanity under the sun  
8	there is one  alone   and  there is  not a second  yea  he hath neither child nor brother  yet  is there  no end of all his labour  neither is his eye satisfied with riches  neither  saith he   for whom do i labour  and bereave my soul of good  this  is  also vanity  yea  it  is  a sore travail  
9	two  are  better than one  because they have a good reward for their labour  
10	for if they fall  the one will lift up his fellow  but woe to him  that is  alone when he falleth  for  he hath  not another to help him up  
11	again  if two lie together  then they have heat  but how can one be warm  alone   
12	and if one prevail against him  two shall withstand him  and a threefold cord is not quickly broken  
13 	better  is  a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king  who will no more be admonished  
14	for out of prison he cometh to reign  whereas also  he that is  born in his kingdom becometh poor  
15	i considered all the living which walk under the sun  with the second child that shall stand up in his stead  
16	 there is  no end of all the people   even  of all that have been before them  they also that come after shall not rejoice in him  surely this also  is  vanity and vexation of spirit  
ecclesiastes 5
1 	keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god  and be more ready to hear  than to give the sacrifice of fools  for they consider not that they do evil  
2	be not rash with thy mouth  and let not thine heart be hasty to utter  any  thing before god  for god  is  in heaven  and thou upon earth  therefore let thy words be few  
3	for a dream cometh through the multitude of business  and a fool s voice  is known  by multitude of words  
4 	when thou vowest a vow unto god  defer not to pay it  for  he hath  no pleasure in fools  pay that which thou hast vowed  
5	better  is it  that thou shouldest not vow  than that thou shouldest vow and not pay  
6	suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin  neither say thou before the angel  that it  was  an error  wherefore should god be angry at thy voice  and destroy the work of thine hands  
7	for in the multitude of dreams and many words  there are  also  divers  vanities  but fear thou god  
8	if thou seest the oppression of the poor  and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province  marvel not at the matter  for  he that is  higher than the highest regardeth  and  there be  higher than they  
9 	moreover the profit of the earth is for all  the king  himself  is served by the field  
10	he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver  nor he that loveth abundance with increase  this  is  also vanity  
11	when goods increase  they are increased that eat them  and what good  is there  to the owners thereof  saving the beholding  of them  with their eyes  
12	the sleep of a labouring man  is  sweet  whether he eat little or much  but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep  
13	there is a sore evil  which  i have seen under the sun   namely   riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt  
14	but those riches perish by evil travail  and he begetteth a son  and  there is  nothing in his hand  
15	as he came forth of his mother s womb  naked shall he return to go as he came  and shall take nothing of his labour  which he may carry away in his hand  
16	and this also  is  a sore evil   that  in all points as he came  so shall he go  and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind  
17	all his days also he eateth in darkness  and  he hath  much sorrow and wrath with his sickness  
18 	behold  that  which i have seen   it is  good and comely  for one  to eat and to drink  and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life  which god giveth him  for it  is  his portion  
19	every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth  and hath given him power to eat thereof  and to take his portion  and to rejoice in his labour  this  is  the gift of god  
20	for he shall not much remember the days of his life  because god answereth  him  in the joy of his heart  
ecclesiastes 6
1 	there is an evil which i have seen under the sun  and it  is  common among men  
2	a man to whom god hath given riches  wealth  and honour  so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth  yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof  but a stranger eateth it  this  is  vanity  and it  is  an evil disease  
3	if a man beget an hundred  children   and live many years  so that the days of his years be many  and his soul be not filled with good  and also  that  he have no burial  i say   that  an untimely birth  is  better than he  
4	for he cometh in with vanity  and departeth in darkness  and his name shall be covered with darkness  
5	moreover he hath not seen the sun  nor known  any thing   this hath more rest than the other  
6	yea  though he live a thousand years twice  told   yet hath he seen no good  do not all go to one place  
7 	all the labour of man  is  for his mouth  and yet the appetite is not filled  
8	for what hath the wise more than the fool  what hath the poor  that knoweth to walk before the living  
9	better  is  the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire  this  is  also vanity and vexation of spirit  
10	that which hath been is named already  and it is known that it  is  man  neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he  
11 	seeing there be many things that increase vanity  what  is  man the better  
12	for who knoweth what  is  good for man in  this  life  all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow  for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun  
ecclesiastes 7
1 	a good name  is  better than precious ointment  and the day of death than the day of one s birth  
2	 it is  better to go to the house of mourning  than to go to the house of feasting  for that  is  the end of all men  and the living will lay  it  to his heart  
3	sorrow  is  better than laughter  for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better  
4	the heart of the wise  is  in the house of mourning  but the heart of fools  is  in the house of mirth  
5	 it is  better to hear the rebuke of the wise  than for a man to hear the song of fools  
6	for as the crackling of thorns under a pot  so  is  the laughter of the fool  this also  is  vanity  
7 	surely oppression maketh a wise man mad  and a gift destroyeth the heart  
8	better  is  the end of a thing than the beginning thereof   and  the patient in spirit  is  better than the proud in spirit  
9	be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry  for anger resteth in the bosom of fools  
10	say not thou  what is  the cause  that the former days were better than these  for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this  
11 	wisdom  is  good with an inheritance  and  by it there is  profit to them that see the sun  
12	for wisdom  is  a defence   and  money  is  a defence  but the excellency of knowledge  is  that  wisdom giveth life to them that have it  
13	consider the work of god  for who can make  that  straight  which he hath made crooked  
14	in the day of prosperity be joyful  but in the day of adversity consider  god also hath set the one over against the other  to the end that man should find nothing after him  
15	all  things  have i seen in the days of my vanity  there is a just  man  that perisheth in his righteousness  and there is a wicked  man  that prolongeth  his life  in his wickedness  
16	be not righteous over much  neither make thyself over wise  why shouldest thou destroy thyself  
17	be not over much wicked  neither be thou foolish  why shouldest thou die before thy time  
18	 it is  good that thou shouldest take hold of this  yea  also from this withdraw not thine hand  for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all  
19	wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty  men  which are in the city  
20	for  there is  not a just man upon earth  that doeth good  and sinneth not  
21	also take no heed unto all words that are spoken  lest thou hear thy servant curse thee  
22	for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others  
23 	all this have i proved by wisdom  i said  i will be wise  but it  was  far from me  
24	that which is far off  and exceeding deep  who can find it out  
25	i applied mine heart to know  and to search  and to seek out wisdom  and the reason  of things   and to know the wickedness of folly  even of foolishness  and  madness  
26	and i find more bitter than death the woman  whose heart  is  snares and nets   and  her hands  as  bands  whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her  but the sinner shall be taken by her  
27	behold  this have i found  saith the preacher   counting  one by one  to find out the account  
28	which yet my soul seeketh  but i find not  one man among a thousand have i found  but a woman among all those have i not found  
29	lo  this only have i found  that god hath made man upright  but they have sought out many inventions  
ecclesiastes 8
1 	who  is  as the wise  man   and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing  a man s wisdom maketh his face to shine  and the boldness of his face shall be changed  
2	i  counsel thee  to keep the king s commandment  and  that  in regard of the oath of god  
3	be not hasty to go out of his sight  stand not in an evil thing  for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him  
4	where the word of a king  is  there is  power  and who may say unto him  what doest thou  
5	whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing  and a wise man s heart discerneth both time and judgment  
6 	because to every purpose there is time and judgment  therefore the misery of man  is  great upon him  
7	for he knoweth not that which shall be  for who can tell him when it shall be  
8	 there is  no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit  neither  hath he  power in the day of death  and  there is  no discharge in  that  war  neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it  
9 	all this have i seen  and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun   there is  a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt  
10	and so i saw the wicked buried  who had come and gone from the place of the holy  and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done  this  is  also vanity  
11	because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily  therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil  
12	though a sinner do evil an hundred times  and his  days  be prolonged  yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god  which fear before him  
13	but it shall not be well with the wicked  neither shall he prolong  his  days   which are  as a shadow  because he feareth not before god  
14 	there is a vanity which is done upon the earth  that there be just  men   unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked  again  there be wicked  men   to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous  i said that this also  is  vanity  
15	then i commended mirth  because a man hath no better thing under the sun  than to eat  and to drink  and to be merry  for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life  which god giveth him under the sun  
16	when i applied mine heart to know wisdom  and to see the business that is done upon the earth   for also  there is that  neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes   
17	then i beheld all the work of god  that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun  because though a man labour to seek  it  out  yet he shall not find  it   yea further  though a wise  man  think to know  it   yet shall he not be able to find  it   
ecclesiastes 9
1 	for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this  that the righteous  and the wise  and their works   are  in the hand of god  no man knoweth either love or hatred  by  all  that is  before them  
2	all  things come  alike to all   there is  one event to the righteous  and to the wicked  to the good and to the clean  and to the unclean  to him that sacrificeth  and to him that sacrificeth not  as  is  the good  so  is  the sinner   and  he that sweareth  as  he  that feareth an oath  
3	this  is  an evil among all  things  that are done under the sun  that  there is  one event unto all  yea  also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil  and madness  is  in their heart while they live  and after that  they go  to the dead  
4 	for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope  for a living dog is better than a dead lion  
5	for the living know that they shall die  but the dead know not any thing  neither have they any more a reward  for the memory of them is forgotten  
6	also their love  and their hatred  and their envy  is now perished  neither have they any more a portion for ever in any  thing  that is done under the sun  
7	go thy way  eat thy bread with joy  and drink thy wine with a merry heart  for god now accepteth thy works  
8	let thy garments be always white  and let thy head lack no ointment  
9	live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity  which he hath given thee under the sun  all the days of thy vanity  for that  is  thy portion in  this  life  and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun  
10	whatsoever thy hand findeth to do  do  it  with thy might  for  there is  no work  nor device  nor knowledge  nor wisdom  in the grave  whither thou goest  
11 	i returned  and saw under the sun  that the race  is  not to the swift  nor the battle to the strong  neither yet bread to the wise  nor yet riches to men of understanding  nor yet favour to men of skill  but time and chance happeneth to them all  
12	for man also knoweth not his time  as the fishes that are taken in an evil net  and as the birds that are caught in the snare  so  are  the sons of men snared in an evil time  when it falleth suddenly upon them  
13 	this wisdom have i seen also under the sun  and it  seemed  great unto me  
14	 there was  a little city  and few men within it  and there came a great king against it  and besieged it  and built great bulwarks against it  
15	now there was found in it a poor wise man  and he by his wisdom delivered the city  yet no man remembered that same poor man  
16	then said i  wisdom  is  better than strength  nevertheless the poor man s wisdom  is  despised  and his words are not heard  
17	the words of wise  men are  heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools  
18	wisdom  is  better than weapons of war  but one sinner destroyeth much good  
ecclesiastes 10
1 	dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour   so doth  a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom  and  honour  
2	a wise man s heart  is  at his right hand  but a fool s heart at his left  
3	yea also  when he that is a fool walketh by the way  his wisdom faileth  him   and he saith to every one  that  he  is  a fool  
4 	if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee  leave not thy place  for yielding pacifieth great offences  
5	there is an evil  which  i have seen under the sun  as an error  which  proceedeth from the ruler  
6	folly is set in great dignity  and the rich sit in low place  
7	i have seen servants upon horses  and princes walking as servants upon the earth  
8	he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it  and whoso breaketh an hedge  a serpent shall bite him  
9	whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith   and  he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby  
10	if the iron be blunt  and he do not whet the edge  then must he put to more strength  but wisdom  is  profitable to direct  
11	surely the serpent will bite without enchantment  and a babbler is no better  
12 	the words of a wise man s mouth  are  gracious  but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself  
13	the beginning of the words of his mouth  is  foolishness  and the end of his talk  is  mischievous madness  
14	a fool also is full of words  a man cannot tell what shall be  and what shall be after him  who can tell him  
15	the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them  because he knoweth not how to go to the city  
16 	woe to thee  o land  when thy king  is  a child  and thy princes eat in the morning  
17	blessed  art  thou  o land  when thy king  is  the son of nobles  and thy princes eat in due season  for strength  and not for drunkenness  
18	by much slothfulness the building decayeth  and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through  
19	a feast is made for laughter  and wine maketh merry  but money answereth all  things   
20	curse not the king  no not in thy thought  and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber  for a bird of the air shall carry the voice  and that which hath wings shall tell the matter  
ecclesiastes 11
1 	cast thy bread upon the waters  for thou shalt find it after many days  
2	give a portion to seven  and also to eight  for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth  
3	if the clouds be full of rain  they empty  themselves  upon the earth  and if the tree fall toward the south  or toward the north  in the place where the tree falleth  there it shall be  
4	he that observeth the wind shall not sow  and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap  
5	as thou knowest not what  is  the way of the spirit   nor  how the bones  do grow  in the womb of her that is with child  even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all  
6	in the morning sow thy seed  and in the evening withhold not thine hand  for thou knowest not whether shall prosper  either this or that  or whether they both  shall be  alike good  
7 	truly the light  is  sweet  and a pleasant  thing it is  for the eyes to behold the sun  
8	but if a man live many years   and  rejoice in them all  yet let him remember the days of darkness  for they shall be many  all that cometh  is  vanity  
9	rejoice  o young man  in thy youth  and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth  and walk in the ways of thine heart  and in the sight of thine eyes  but know thou  that for all these  things  god will bring thee into judgment  
10	therefore remove sorrow from thy heart  and put away evil from thy flesh  for childhood and youth  are  vanity  
ecclesiastes 12
1 	remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth  while the evil days come not  nor the years draw nigh  when thou shalt say  i have no pleasure in them  
2	while the sun  or the light  or the moon  or the stars  be not darkened  nor the clouds return after the rain  
3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble  and the strong men shall bow themselves  and the grinders cease because they are few  and those that look out of the windows be darkened  
4	and the doors shall be shut in the streets  when the sound of the grinding is low  and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird  and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low  
5	also  when  they shall be afraid of  that which is  high  and fears  shall be  in the way  and the almond tree shall flourish  and the grasshopper shall be a burden  and desire shall fail  because man goeth to his long home  and the mourners go about the streets  
6	or ever the silver cord be loosed  or the golden bowl be broken  or the pitcher be broken at the fountain  or the wheel broken at the cistern  
7	then shall the dust return to the earth as it was  and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it  
8 	vanity of vanities  saith the preacher  all  is  vanity  
9	and moreover  because the preacher was wise  he still taught the people knowledge  yea  he gave good heed  and sought out   and  set in order many proverbs  
10	the preacher sought to find out acceptable words  and  that which was  written  was  upright   even  words of truth  
11	the words of the wise  are  as goads  and as nails fastened  by  the masters of assemblies   which  are given from one shepherd  
12	and further  by these  my son  be admonished  of making many books  there is  no end  and much study  is  a weariness of the flesh  
13 	let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter  fear god  and keep his commandments  for this  is  the whole  duty  of man  
14	for god shall bring every work into judgment  with every secret thing  whether  it be  good  or whether  it be  evil

10	i  am  a wall  and my breasts like towers  then was i in his eyes as one that found favour  
11	solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon  he let out the vineyard unto keepers  every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand  pieces  of silver  
12	my vineyard  which  is  mine   is  before me  thou  o solomon   must have  a thousand  and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred  
13 	thou that dwellest in the gardens  the companions hearken to thy voice  cause me to hear  it   
14	make haste  my beloved  and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices  

isaiah
isaiah 1
1 	the vision of isaiah the son of amoz  which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah  jotham  ahaz   and  hezekiah  kings of judah  
2 	hear  o heavens  and give ear  o earth  for the lord hath spoken  i have nourished and brought up children  and they have rebelled against me  
3	the ox knoweth his owner  and the ass his master s crib   but  israel doth not know  my people doth not consider  
4	ah sinful nation  a people laden with iniquity  a seed of evildoers  children that are corrupters  they have forsaken the lord  they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger  they are gone away backward  
5	why should ye be stricken any more  ye will revolt more and more  the whole head is sick  and the whole heart faint  
6	from the sole of the foot even unto the head  there is  no soundness in it   but  wounds  and bruises  and putrifying sores  they have not been closed  neither bound up  neither mollified with ointment  
7	your country  is  desolate  your cities  are  burned with fire  your land  strangers devour it in your presence  and  it is  desolate  as overthrown by strangers  
8	and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard  as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers  as a besieged city  
9	except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant  we should have been as sodom   and  we should have been like unto gomorrah  
10 	hear the word of the lord  ye rulers of sodom  give ear unto the law of our god  ye people of gomorrah  
11	to what purpose  is  the multitude of your sacrifices unto me  saith the lord  i am full of the burnt offerings of rams  and the fat of fed beasts  and i delight not in the blood of bullocks  or of lambs  or of he goats  
12	when ye come to appear before me  who hath required this at your hand  to tread my courts  
13	bring no more vain oblations  incense is an abomination unto me  the new moons and sabbaths  the calling of assemblies  i cannot away with   it is  iniquity  even the solemn meeting  
14	your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth  they are a trouble unto me  i am weary to bear  them   
15	and when ye spread forth your hands  i will hide mine eyes from you  yea  when ye make many prayers  i will not hear  your hands are full of blood  
16 	wash you  make you clean  put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes  cease to do evil  
17	learn to do well  seek judgment  relieve the oppressed  judge the fatherless  plead for the widow  
18	come now  and let us reason together  saith the lord  though your sins be as scarlet  they shall be as white as snow  though they be red like crimson  they shall be as wool  
19	if ye be willing and obedient  ye shall eat the good of the land  
20	but if ye refuse and rebel  ye shall be devoured with the sword  for the mouth of the lord hath spoken  it   
21 	how is the faithful city become an harlot  it was full of judgment  righteousness lodged in it  but now murderers  
22	thy silver is become dross  thy wine mixed with water  
23	thy princes  are  rebellious  and companions of thieves  every one loveth gifts  and followeth after rewards  they judge not the fatherless  neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them  
24	therefore saith the lord  the lord of hosts  the mighty one of israel  ah  i will ease me of mine adversaries  and avenge me of mine enemies  
25	and i will turn my hand upon thee  and purely purge away thy dross  and take away all thy tin  
26	and i will restore thy judges as at the first  and thy counsellors as at the beginning  afterward thou shalt be called  the city of righteousness  the faithful city  
27	zion shall be redeemed with judgment  and her converts with righteousness  
28	and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners  shall be  together  and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed  
29	for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired  and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen  
30	for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth  and as a garden that hath no water  
31	and the strong shall be as tow  and the maker of it as a spark  and they shall both burn together  and none shall quench  them   
isaiah 2
1 	the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem  
2	and it shall come to pass in the last days   that  the mountain of the lord s house shall be established in the top of the mountains  and shall be exalted above the hills  and all nations shall flow unto it  
3	and many people shall go and say  come ye  and let us go up to the mountain of the lord  to the house of the god of jacob  and he will teach us of his ways  and we will walk in his paths  for out of zion shall go forth the law  and the word of the lord from jerusalem  
4	and he shall judge among the nations  and shall rebuke many people  and they shall beat their swords into plowshares  and their spears into pruninghooks  nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more  
5	o house of jacob  come ye  and let us walk in the light of the lord  
6 	therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob  because they be replenished from the east  and  are  soothsayers like the philistines  and they please themselves in the children of strangers  
7	their land also is full of silver and gold  neither  is there any  end of their treasures  their land is also full of horses  neither  is there any  end of their chariots  
8	their land also is full of idols  they worship the work of their own hands  that which their own fingers have made  
9	and the mean man boweth down  and the great man humbleth himself  therefore forgive them not  
10 	enter into the rock  and hide thee in the dust  for fear of the lord  and for the glory of his majesty  
11	the lofty looks of man shall be humbled  and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down  and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day  
12	for the day of the lord of hosts  shall be  upon every  one that is  proud and lofty  and upon every  one that is  lifted up  and he shall be brought low  
13	and upon all the cedars of lebanon   that are  high and lifted up  and upon all the oaks of bashan  
14	and upon all the high mountains  and upon all the hills  that are  lifted up  
15	and upon every high tower  and upon every fenced wall  
16	and upon all the ships of tarshish  and upon all pleasant pictures  
17	and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down  and the haughtiness of men shall be made low  and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day  
18	and the idols he shall utterly abolish  
19	and they shall go into the holes of the rocks  and into the caves of the earth  for fear of the lord  and for the glory of his majesty  when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth  
20	in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver  and his idols of gold  which they made  each one  for himself to worship  to the moles and to the bats  
21	to go into the clefts of the rocks  and into the tops of the ragged rocks  for fear of the lord  and for the glory of his majesty  when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth  
22	cease ye from man  whose breath  is  in his nostrils  for wherein is he to be accounted of  
isaiah 3
1 	for  behold  the lord  the lord of hosts  doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff  the whole stay of bread  and the whole stay of water  
2	the mighty man  and the man of war  the judge  and the prophet  and the prudent  and the ancient  
3	the captain of fifty  and the honourable man  and the counsellor  and the cunning artificer  and the eloquent orator  
4	and i will give children  to be  their princes  and babes shall rule over them  
5	and the people shall be oppressed  every one by another  and every one by his neighbour  the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient  and the base against the honourable  
6	when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father   saying   thou hast clothing  be thou our ruler  and  let  this ruin  be  under thy hand  
7	in that day shall he swear  saying  i will not be an healer  for in my house  is  neither bread nor clothing  make me not a ruler of the people  
8	for jerusalem is ruined  and judah is fallen  because their tongue and their doings  are  against the lord  to provoke the eyes of his glory  
9 	the shew of their countenance doth witness against them  and they declare their sin as sodom  they hide  it  not  woe unto their soul  for they have rewarded evil unto themselves  
10	say ye to the righteous  that  it shall be  well  with him   for they shall eat the fruit of their doings  
11	woe unto the wicked   it shall be  ill  with him   for the reward of his hands shall be given him  
12	 as for  my people  children  are  their oppressors  and women rule over them  o my people  they which lead thee cause  thee  to err  and destroy the way of thy paths  
13	the lord standeth up to plead  and standeth to judge the people  
14	the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people  and the princes thereof  for ye have eaten up the vineyard  the spoil of the poor  is  in your houses  
15	what mean ye  that  ye beat my people to pieces  and grind the faces of the poor  saith the lord god of hosts  
16 	moreover the lord saith  because the daughters of zion are haughty  and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes  walking and mincing  as  they go  and making a tinkling with their feet  
17	therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion  and the lord will discover their secret parts  
18	in that day the lord will take away the bravery of  their  tinkling ornaments  about their feet   and  their  cauls  and  their  round tires like the moon  
19	the chains  and the bracelets  and the mufflers  
20	the bonnets  and the ornaments of the legs  and the headbands  and the tablets  and the earrings  
21	the rings  and nose jewels  
22	the changeable suits of apparel  and the mantles  and the wimples  and the crisping pins  
23	the glasses  and the fine linen  and the hoods  and the vails  
24	and it shall come to pass   that  instead of sweet smell there shall be stink  and instead of a girdle a rent  and instead of well set hair baldness  and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth   and  burning instead of beauty  
25	thy men shall fall by the sword  and thy mighty in the war  
26	and her gates shall lament and mourn  and she  being  desolate shall sit upon the ground  
isaiah 4
1 	and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man  saying  we will eat our own bread  and wear our own apparel  only let us be called by thy name  to take away our reproach  
2 	in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious  and the fruit of the earth  shall be  excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel  
3	and it shall come to pass   that he that is  left in zion  and  he that  remaineth in jerusalem  shall be called holy   even  every one that is written among the living in jerusalem  
4	when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion  and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment  and by the spirit of burning  
5	and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion  and upon her assemblies  a cloud and smoke by day  and the shining of a flaming fire by night  for upon all the glory  shall be  a defence  
6	and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat  and for a place of refuge  and for a covert from storm and from rain  
isaiah 5
1 	now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard  my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill  
2	and he fenced it  and gathered out the stones thereof  and planted it with the choicest vine  and built a tower in the midst of it  and also made a winepress therein  and he looked that it should bring forth grapes  and it brought forth wild grapes  
3	and now  o inhabitants of jerusalem  and men of judah  judge  i pray you  betwixt me and my vineyard  
4	what could have been done more to my vineyard  that i have not done in it  wherefore  when i looked that it should bring forth grapes  brought it forth wild grapes  
5	and now go to  i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard  i will take away the hedge thereof  and it shall be eaten up   and  break down the wall thereof  and it shall be trodden down  
6	and i will lay it waste  it shall not be pruned  nor digged  but there shall come up briers and thorns  i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it  
7	for the vineyard of the lord of hosts  is  the house of israel  and the men of judah his pleasant plant  and he looked for judgment  but behold oppression  for righteousness  but behold a cry  
8 	woe unto them that join house to house   that  lay field to field  till  there be  no place  that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth  
9	in mine ears  said  the lord of hosts  of a truth many houses shall be desolate   even  great and fair  without inhabitant  
10	yea  ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath  and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah  
11	woe unto them that rise up early in the morning   that  they may follow strong drink  that continue until night   till  wine inflame them  
12	and the harp  and the viol  the tabret  and pipe  and wine  are in their feasts  but they regard not the work of the lord  neither consider the operation of his hands  
13	therefore my people are gone into captivity  because  they have  no knowledge  and their honourable men  are  famished  and their multitude dried up with thirst  
14	therefore hell hath enlarged herself  and opened her mouth without measure  and their glory  and their multitude  and their pomp  and he that rejoiceth  shall descend into it  
15	and the mean man shall be brought down  and the mighty man shall be humbled  and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled  
16	but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment  and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness  
17	then shall the lambs feed after their manner  and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat  
18 	woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity  and sin as it were with a cart rope  
19	that say  let him make speed   and  hasten his work  that we may see  it   and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come  that we may know  it   
20	woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter  
21	woe unto  them that are  wise in their own eyes  and prudent in their own sight  
22	woe unto  them that are  mighty to drink wine  and men of strength to mingle strong drink  
23	which justify the wicked for reward  and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him  
24	therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble  and the flame consumeth the chaff   so  their root shall be as rottenness  and their blossom shall go up as dust  because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts  and despised the word of the holy one of israel  
25	therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people  and he hath stretched forth his hand against them  and hath smitten them  and the hills did tremble  and their carcases  were  torn in the midst of the streets  for all this his anger is not turned away  but his hand  is  stretched out still  
26	and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far  and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth  and  behold  they shall come with speed swiftly  
27	none shall be weary nor stumble among them  none shall slumber nor sleep  neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed  nor the latchet of their shoes be broken  
28	whose arrows  are  sharp  and all their bows bent  their horses  hoofs shall be counted like flint  and their wheels like a whirlwind  
29	their roaring  shall be  like a lion  they shall roar like young lions  yea  they shall roar  and lay hold of the prey  and shall carry  it  away safe  and none shall deliver  it   
30	and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea  and if  one  look unto the land  behold darkness  and  sorrow  and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof  
isaiah 6
1 	in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne  high and lifted up  and his train filled the temple  
2	above it stood the seraphims  each one had six wings  with twain he covered his face  and with twain he covered his feet  and with twain he did fly  
3	and one cried unto another  and said  holy  holy  holy   is  the lord of hosts  the whole earth  is  full of his glory  
4	and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried  and the house was filled with smoke  
5 	then said i  woe  is  me  for i am undone  because i  am  a man of unclean lips  and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips  for mine eyes have seen the king  the lord of hosts  
6	then flew one of the seraphims unto me  having a live coal in his hand   which  he had taken with the tongs from off the altar  
7	and he laid  it  upon my mouth  and said  lo  this hath touched thy lips  and thine iniquity is taken away  and thy sin purged  
8	also i heard the voice of the lord  saying  whom shall i send  and who will go for us  then said i  here  am  i  send me  
9 	and he said  go  and tell this people  hear ye indeed  but understand not  and see ye indeed  but perceive not  
10	make the heart of this people fat  and make their ears heavy  and shut their eyes  lest they see with their eyes  and hear with their ears  and understand with their heart  and convert  and be healed  
11	then said i  lord  how long  and he answered  until the cities be wasted without inhabitant  and the houses without man  and the land be utterly desolate  
12	and the lord have removed men far away  and  there be  a great forsaking in the midst of the land  
13	but yet in it  shall be  a tenth  and  it  shall return  and shall be eaten  as a teil tree  and as an oak  whose substance  is  in them  when they cast  their leaves  so  the holy seed  shall be  the substance thereof  
isaiah 7
1 	and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham  the son of uzziah  king of judah   that  rezin the king of syria  and pekah the son of remaliah  king of israel  went up toward jerusalem to war against it  but could not prevail against it  
2	and it was told the house of david  saying  syria is confederate with ephraim  and his heart was moved  and the heart of his people  as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind  
3	then said the lord unto isaiah  go forth now to meet ahaz  thou  and shearjashub thy son  at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field  
4	and say unto him  take heed  and be quiet  fear not  neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands  for the fierce anger of rezin with syria  and of the son of remaliah  
5	because syria  ephraim  and the son of remaliah  have taken evil counsel against thee  saying  
6	let us go up against judah  and vex it  and let us make a breach therein for us  and set a king in the midst of it   even  the son of tabeal  
7	thus saith the lord god  it shall not stand  neither shall it come to pass  
8	for the head of syria  is  damascus  and the head of damascus  is  rezin  and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken  that it be not a people  
9	and the head of ephraim  is  samaria  and the head of samaria  is  remaliah s son  if ye will not believe  surely ye shall not be established  
10 	moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz  saying  
11	ask thee a sign of the lord thy god  ask it either in the depth  or in the height above  
12	but ahaz said  i will not ask  neither will i tempt the lord  
13	and he said  hear ye now  o house of david   is it  a small thing for you to weary men  but will ye weary my god also  
14	therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign  behold  a virgin shall conceive  and bear a son  and shall call his name immanuel  
15	butter and honey shall he eat  that he may know to refuse the evil  and choose the good  
16	for before the child shall know to refuse the evil  and choose the good  the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings  
17 	the lord shall bring upon thee  and upon thy people  and upon thy father s house  days that have not come  from the day that ephraim departed from judah   even  the king of assyria  
18	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the lord shall hiss for the fly that  is  in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt  and for the bee that  is  in the land of assyria  
19	and they shall come  and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys  and in the holes of the rocks  and upon all thorns  and upon all bushes  
20	in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired   namely   by them beyond the river  by the king of assyria  the head  and the hair of the feet  and it shall also consume the beard  
21	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  a man shall nourish a young cow  and two sheep  
22	and it shall come to pass  for the abundance of milk  that  they shall give he shall eat butter  for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land  
23	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  every place shall be  where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings  it shall  even  be for briers and thorns  
24	with arrows and with bows shall  men  come thither  because all the land shall become briers and thorns  
25	and  on  all hills that shall be digged with the mattock  there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns  but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen  and for the treading of lesser cattle  
isaiah 8
1 	moreover the lord said unto me  take thee a great roll  and write in it with a man s pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz  
2	and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record  uriah the priest  and zechariah the son of jeberechiah  
3	and i went unto the prophetess  and she conceived  and bare a son  then said the lord to me  call his name mahershalalhashbaz  
4	for before the child shall have knowledge to cry  my father  and my mother  the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria  
5	the lord spake also unto me again  saying  
6	forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly  and rejoice in rezin and remaliah s son  
7	now therefore  behold  the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river  strong and many   even  the king of assyria  and all his glory  and he shall come up over all his channels  and go over all his banks  
8	and he shall pass through judah  he shall overflow and go over  he shall reach  even  to the neck  and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land  o immanuel  
9 	associate yourselves  o ye people  and ye shall be broken in pieces  and give ear  all ye of far countries  gird yourselves  and ye shall be broken in pieces  gird yourselves  and ye shall be broken in pieces  
10	take counsel together  and it shall come to nought  speak the word  and it shall not stand  for god  is  with us  
11	for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand  and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people  saying  
12	say ye not  a confederacy  to all  them to  whom this people shall say  a confederacy  neither fear ye their fear  nor be afraid  
13	sanctify the lord of hosts himself  and  let  him  be  your fear  and  let  him  be  your dread  
14	and he shall be for a sanctuary  but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel  for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem  
15	and many among them shall stumble  and fall  and be broken  and be snared  and be taken  
16 	bind up the testimony  seal the law among my disciples  
17	and i will wait upon the lord  that hideth his face from the house of jacob  and i will look for him  
18	behold  i and the children whom the lord hath given me  are  for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts  which dwelleth in mount zion  
19	and when they shall say unto you  seek unto them that have familiar spirits  and unto wizards that peep  and that mutter  should not a people seek unto their god  for the living to the dead  
20	to the law and to the testimony  if they speak not according to this word   it is  because  there is  no light in them  
21	and they shall pass through it  hardly bestead and hungry  and it shall come to pass  that when they shall be hungry  they shall fret themselves  and curse their king and their god  and look upward  
22	and they shall look unto the earth  and behold trouble and darkness  dimness of anguish  and  they shall be  driven to darkness  
isaiah 9
1 	nevertheless the dimness  shall  not  be  such as  was  in her vexation  when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali  and afterward did more grievously afflict  her by  the way of the sea  beyond jordan  in galilee of the nations  
2	the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light  they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death  upon them hath the light shined  
3	thou hast multiplied the nation   and  not increased the joy  they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest   and  as  men  rejoice when they divide the spoil  
4	for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden  and the staff of his shoulder  the rod of his oppressor  as in the day of midian  
5	for every battle of the warrior  is  with confused noise  and garments rolled in blood  but  this  shall be with burning  and  fuel of fire  
6	for unto us a child is born  unto us a son is given  and the government shall be upon his shoulder  and his name shall be called wonderful  counsellor  the mighty god  the everlasting father  the prince of peace  
7	of the increase of  his  government and peace  there shall be  no end  upon the throne of david  and upon his kingdom  to order it  and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever  the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this  
8 	the lord sent a word into jacob  and it hath lighted upon israel  
9	and all the people shall know   even  ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria  that say in the pride and stoutness of heart  
10	the bricks are fallen down  but we will build with hewn stones  the sycomores are cut down  but we will change  them into  cedars  
11	therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him  and join his enemies together  
12	the syrians before  and the philistines behind  and they shall devour israel with open mouth  for all this his anger is not turned away  but his hand  is  stretched out still  
13	for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them  neither do they seek the lord of hosts  
14	therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail  branch and rush  in one day  
15	the ancient and honourable  he  is  the head  and the prophet that teacheth lies  he  is  the tail  
16	for the leaders of this people cause  them  to err  and  they that are  led of them  are  destroyed  
17	therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men  neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows  for every one  is  an hypocrite and an evildoer  and every mouth speaketh folly  for all this his anger is not turned away  but his hand  is  stretched out still  
18	for wickedness burneth as the fire  it shall devour the briers and thorns  and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest  and they shall mount up  like  the lifting up of smoke  
19	through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened  and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire  no man shall spare his brother  
20	and he shall snatch on the right hand  and be hungry  and he shall eat on the left hand  and they shall not be satisfied  they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm  
21	manasseh  ephraim  and ephraim  manasseh   and  they together  shall be  against judah  for all this his anger is not turned away  but his hand  is  stretched out still  
isaiah 10
1 	woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees  and that write grievousness  which  they have prescribed  
2	to turn aside the needy from judgment  and to take away the right from the poor of my people  that widows may be their prey  and  that  they may rob the fatherless  
3	and what will ye do in the day of visitation  and in the desolation  which  shall come from far  to whom will ye flee for help  and where will ye leave your glory  
4	without me they shall bow down under the prisoners  and they shall fall under the slain  for all this his anger is not turned away  but his hand  is  stretched out still  
5 	o assyrian  the rod of mine anger  and the staff in their hand is mine indignation  
6	i will send him against an hypocritical nation  and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge  to take the spoil  and to take the prey  and to tread them down like the mire of the streets  
7	howbeit he meaneth not so  neither doth his heart think so  but  it is  in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few  
8	for he saith   are  not my princes altogether kings  
9	 is  not calno as carchemish   is  not hamath as arpad   is  not samaria as damascus  
10	as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols  and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria  
11	shall i not  as i have done unto samaria and her idols  so do to jerusalem and her idols  
12	wherefore it shall come to pass   that  when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem  i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria  and the glory of his high looks  
13	for he saith  by the strength of my hand i have done  it   and by my wisdom  for i am prudent  and i have removed the bounds of the people  and have robbed their treasures  and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant  man   
14	and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people  and as one gathereth eggs  that are  left  have i gathered all the earth  and there was none that moved the wing  or opened the mouth  or peeped  
15	shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith   or  shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it  as if the rod should shake  itself  against them that lift it up   or  as if the staff should lift up  itself  as if it were  no wood  
16	therefore shall the lord  the lord of hosts  send among his fat ones leanness  and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire  
17	and the light of israel shall be for a fire  and his holy one for a flame  and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day  
18	and shall consume the glory of his forest  and of his fruitful field  both soul and body  and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth  
19	and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few  that a child may write them  
20 	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the remnant of israel  and such as are escaped of the house of jacob  shall no more again stay upon him that smote them  but shall stay upon the lord  the holy one of israel  in truth  
21	the remnant shall return   even  the remnant of jacob  unto the mighty god  
22	for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea   yet  a remnant of them shall return  the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness  
23	for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption  even determined  in the midst of all the land  
24 	therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts  o my people that dwellest in zion  be not afraid of the assyrian  he shall smite thee with a rod  and shall lift up his staff against thee  after the manner of egypt  
25	for yet a very little while  and the indignation shall cease  and mine anger in their destruction  
26	and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb  and  as  his rod  was  upon the sea  so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt  
27	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder  and his yoke from off thy neck  and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing  
28	he is come to aiath  he is passed to migron  at michmash he hath laid up his carriages  
29	they are gone over the passage  they have taken up their lodging at geba  ramah is afraid  gibeah of saul is fled  
30	lift up thy voice  o daughter of gallim  cause it to be heard unto laish  o poor anathoth  
31	madmenah is removed  the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee  
32	as yet shall he remain at nob that day  he shall shake his hand  against  the mount of the daughter of zion  the hill of jerusalem  
33	behold  the lord  the lord of hosts  shall lop the bough with terror  and the high ones of stature  shall be  hewn down  and the haughty shall be humbled  
34	and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron  and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one  
isaiah 11
1 	and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse  and a branch shall grow out of his roots  
2	and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him  the spirit of wisdom and understanding  the spirit of counsel and might  the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord  
3	and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord  and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes  neither reprove after the hearing of his ears  
4	but with righteousness shall he judge the poor  and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth  and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth  and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked  
5	and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins  and faithfulness the girdle of his reins  
6	the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb  and the leopard shall lie down with the kid  and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together  and a little child shall lead them  
7	and the cow and the bear shall feed  their young ones shall lie down together  and the lion shall eat straw like the ox  
8	and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp  and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice  den  
9	they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain  for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord  as the waters cover the sea  
10 	and in that day there shall be a root of jesse  which shall stand for an ensign of the people  to it shall the gentiles seek  and his rest shall be glorious  
11	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people  which shall be left  from assyria  and from egypt  and from pathros  and from cush  and from elam  and from shinar  and from hamath  and from the islands of the sea  
12	and he shall set up an ensign for the nations  and shall assemble the outcasts of israel  and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth  
13	the envy also of ephraim shall depart  and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off  ephraim shall not envy judah  and judah shall not vex ephraim  
14	but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west  they shall spoil them of the east together  they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab  and the children of ammon shall obey them  
15	and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea  and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river  and shall smite it in the seven streams  and make  men  go over dryshod  
16	and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people  which shall be left  from assyria  like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt  
isaiah 12
1 	and in that day thou shalt say  o lord  i will praise thee  though thou wast angry with me  thine anger is turned away  and thou comfortedst me  
2	behold  god  is  my salvation  i will trust  and not be afraid  for the lord jehovah  is  my strength and  my  song  he also is become my salvation  
3	therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation  
4 	and in that day shall ye say  praise the lord  call upon his name  declare his doings among the people  make mention that his name is exalted  
5	sing unto the lord  for he hath done excellent things  this  is  known in all the earth  
6	cry out and shout  thou inhabitant of zion  for great  is  the holy one of israel in the midst of thee  
isaiah 13
1 	the burden of babylon  which isaiah the son of amoz did see  
2	lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain  exalt the voice unto them  shake the hand  that they may go into the gates of the nobles  
3	i have commanded my sanctified ones  i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger   even  them that rejoice in my highness  
4	the noise of a multitude in the mountains  like as of a great people  a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together  the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle  
5	they come from a far country  from the end of heaven   even  the lord  and the weapons of his indignation  to destroy the whole land  
6 	howl ye  for the day of the lord  is  at hand  it shall come as a destruction from the almighty  
7	therefore shall all hands be faint  and every man s heart shall melt  
8	and they shall be afraid  pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them  they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth  they shall be amazed one at another  their faces  shall be as  flames  
9	behold  the day of the lord cometh  cruel both with wrath and fierce anger  to lay the land desolate  and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it  
10	for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light  the sun shall be darkened in his going forth  and the moon shall not cause her light to shine  
11	and i will punish the world for  their  evil  and the wicked for their iniquity  and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease  and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible  
12	i will make a man more precious than fine gold  even a man than the golden wedge of ophir  
13	therefore i will shake the heavens  and the earth shall remove out of her place  in the wrath of the lord of hosts  and in the day of his fierce anger  
14	and it shall be as the chased roe  and as a sheep that no man taketh up  they shall every man turn to his own people  and flee every one into his own land  
15	every one that is found shall be thrust through  and every one that is joined  unto them  shall fall by the sword  
16	their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes  their houses shall be spoiled  and their wives ravished  
17	behold  i will stir up the medes against them  which shall not regard silver  and  as for  gold  they shall not delight in it  
18	 their  bows also shall dash the young men to pieces  and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb  their eye shall not spare children  
19 	and babylon  the glory of kingdoms  the beauty of the chaldees  excellency  shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah  
20	it shall never be inhabited  neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation  neither shall the arabian pitch tent there  neither shall the shepherds make their fold there  
21	but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there  and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures  and owls shall dwell there  and satyrs shall dance there  
22	and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses  and dragons in  their  pleasant palaces  and her time  is  near to come  and her days shall not be prolonged  
isaiah 14
1 	for the lord will have mercy on jacob  and will yet choose israel  and set them in their own land  and the strangers shall be joined with them  and they shall cleave to the house of jacob  
2	and the people shall take them  and bring them to their place  and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids  and they shall take them captives  whose captives they were  and they shall rule over their oppressors  
3	and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow  and from thy fear  and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve  
4 	that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon  and say  how hath the oppressor ceased  the golden city ceased  
5	the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked   and  the sceptre of the rulers  
6	he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke  he that ruled the nations in anger  is persecuted   and  none hindereth  
7	the whole earth is at rest   and  is quiet  they break forth into singing  
8	yea  the fir trees rejoice at thee   and  the cedars of lebanon   saying   since thou art laid down  no feller is come up against us  
9	hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet  thee  at thy coming  it stirreth up the dead for thee   even  all the chief ones of the earth  it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations  
10	all they shall speak and say unto thee  art thou also become weak as we  art thou become like unto us  
11	thy pomp is brought down to the grave   and  the noise of thy viols  the worm is spread under thee  and the worms cover thee  
12	how art thou fallen from heaven  o lucifer  son of the morning   how  art thou cut down to the ground  which didst weaken the nations  
13	for thou hast said in thine heart  i will ascend into heaven  i will exalt my throne above the stars of god  i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation  in the sides of the north  
14	i will ascend above the heights of the clouds  i will be like the most high  
15	yet thou shalt be brought down to hell  to the sides of the pit  
16	they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee   and  consider thee   saying  is  this the man that made the earth to tremble  that did shake kingdoms  
17	 that  made the world as a wilderness  and destroyed the cities thereof   that  opened not the house of his prisoners  
18	all the kings of the nations   even  all of them  lie in glory  every one in his own house  
19	but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch   and as  the raiment of those that are slain  thrust through with a sword  that go down to the stones of the pit  as a carcase trodden under feet  
20	thou shalt not be joined with them in burial  because thou hast destroyed thy land   and  slain thy people  the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned  
21	prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers  that they do not rise  nor possess the land  nor fill the face of the world with cities  
22	for i will rise up against them  saith the lord of hosts  and cut off from babylon the name  and remnant  and son  and nephew  saith the lord  
23	i will also make it a possession for the bittern  and pools of water  and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction  saith the lord of hosts  
24 	the lord of hosts hath sworn  saying  surely as i have thought  so shall it come to pass  and as i have purposed   so  shall it stand  
25	that i will break the assyrian in my land  and upon my mountains tread him under foot  then shall his yoke depart from off them  and his burden depart from off their shoulders  
26	this  is  the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth  and this  is  the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations  
27	for the lord of hosts hath purposed  and who shall disannul  it   and his hand  is  stretched out  and who shall turn it back  
28	in the year that king ahaz died was this burden  
29	rejoice not thou  whole palestina  because the rod of him that smote thee is broken  for out of the serpent s root shall come forth a cockatrice  and his fruit  shall be  a fiery flying serpent  
30	and the firstborn of the poor shall feed  and the needy shall lie down in safety  and i will kill thy root with famine  and he shall slay thy remnant  
31	howl  o gate  cry  o city  thou  whole palestina   art  dissolved  for there shall come from the north a smoke  and none  shall be  alone in his appointed times  
32	what shall  one  then answer the messengers of the nation  that the lord hath founded zion  and the poor of his people shall trust in it  
isaiah 15
1 	the burden of moab  because in the night ar of moab is laid waste   and  brought to silence  because in the night kir of moab is laid waste   and  brought to silence  
2	he is gone up to bajith  and to dibon  the high places  to weep  moab shall howl over nebo  and over medeba  on all their heads  shall be  baldness   and  every beard cut off  
3	in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth  on the tops of their houses  and in their streets  every one shall howl  weeping abundantly  
4	and heshbon shall cry  and elealeh  their voice shall be heard  even  unto jahaz  therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out  his life shall be grievous unto him  
5	my heart shall cry out for moab  his fugitives  shall flee  unto zoar  an heifer of three years old  for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up  for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction  
6 	for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate  for the hay is withered away  the grass faileth  there is no green thing  
7	therefore the abundance they have gotten  and that which they have laid up  shall they carry away to the brook of the willows  
8	for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab  the howling thereof unto eglaim  and the howling thereof unto beerelim  
9	for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood  for i will bring more upon dimon  lions upon him that escapeth of moab  and upon the remnant of the land  
isaiah 16
1 	send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness  unto the mount of the daughter of zion  
2	for it shall be   that   as a wandering bird cast out of the nest   so  the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon  
3	take counsel  execute judgment  make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday  hide the outcasts  bewray not him that wandereth  
4	let mine outcasts dwell with thee  moab  be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler  for the extortioner is at an end  the spoiler ceaseth  the oppressors are consumed out of the land  
5	and in mercy shall the throne be established  and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david  judging  and seeking judgment  and hasting righteousness  
6 	we have heard of the pride of moab   he is  very proud   even  of his haughtiness  and his pride  and his wrath   but  his lies  shall  not  be  so  
7	therefore shall moab howl for moab  every one shall howl  for the foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn  surely  they are  stricken  
8	for the fields of heshbon languish   and  the vine of sibmah  the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof  they are come  even  unto jazer  they wandered  through  the wilderness  her branches are stretched out  they are gone over the sea  
9	therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah  i will water thee with my tears  o heshbon  and elealeh  for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen  
10	and gladness is taken away  and joy out of the plentiful field  and in the vineyards there shall be no singing  neither shall there be shouting  the treaders shall tread out no wine in  their  presses  i have made  their vintage  shouting to cease  
11	wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab  and mine inward parts for kirharesh  
12	and it shall come to pass  when it is seen that moab is weary on the high place  that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray  but he shall not prevail  
13	this  is  the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since that time  
14	but now the lord hath spoken  saying  within three years  as the years of an hireling  and the glory of moab shall be contemned  with all that great multitude  and the remnant  shall be  very small  and  feeble

1 	the burden of damascus  behold  damascus is taken away from  being  a city  and it shall be a ruinous heap  
2	the cities of aroer  are  forsaken  they shall be for flocks  which shall lie down  and none shall make  them  afraid  
3	the fortress also shall cease from ephraim  and the kingdom from damascus  and the remnant of syria  they shall be as the glory of the children of israel  saith the lord of hosts  
4	and in that day it shall come to pass   that  the glory of jacob shall be made thin  and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean  
5	and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn  and reapeth the ears with his arm  and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim  
6 	yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it  as the shaking of an olive tree  two  or  three berries in the top of the uppermost bough  four  or  five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof  saith the lord god of israel  
7	at that day shall a man look to his maker  and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel  
8	and he shall not look to the altars  the work of his hands  neither shall respect  that  which his fingers have made  either the groves  or the images  
9 	in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough  and an uppermost branch  which they left because of the children of israel  and there shall be desolation  
10	because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation  and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength  therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants  and shalt set it with strange slips  
11	in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow  and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish   but  the harvest  shall be  a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow  
12 	woe to the multitude of many people   which  make a noise like the noise of the seas  and to the rushing of nations   that  make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters  
13	the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters  but  god  shall rebuke them  and they shall flee far off  and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind  and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind  
14	and behold at eveningtide trouble   and  before the morning he  is  not  this  is  the portion of them that spoil us  and the lot of them that rob us  
isaiah 18
1 	woe to the land shadowing with wings  which  is  beyond the rivers of ethiopia  
2	that sendeth ambassadors by the sea  even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters   saying   go  ye swift messengers  to a nation scattered and peeled  to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto  a nation meted out and trodden down  whose land the rivers have spoiled  
3	all ye inhabitants of the world  and dwellers on the earth  see ye  when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains  and when he bloweth a trumpet  hear ye  
4	for so the lord said unto me  i will take my rest  and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs   and  like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest  
5	for afore the harvest  when the bud is perfect  and the sour grape is ripening in the flower  he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks  and take away  and  cut down the branches  
6	they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains  and to the beasts of the earth  and the fowls shall summer upon them  and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them  
7	in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled  and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto  a nation meted out and trodden under foot  whose land the rivers have spoiled  to the place of the name of the lord of hosts  the mount zion

1 	the burden of egypt  behold  the lord rideth upon a swift cloud  and shall come into egypt  and the idols of egypt shall be moved at his presence  and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it  
2	and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians  and they shall fight every one against his brother  and every one against his neighbour  city against city   and  kingdom against kingdom  
3	and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof  and i will destroy the counsel thereof  and they shall seek to the idols  and to the charmers  and to them that have familiar spirits  and to the wizards  
4	and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord  and a fierce king shall rule over them  saith the lord  the lord of hosts  
5	and the waters shall fail from the sea  and the river shall be wasted and dried up  
6	and they shall turn the rivers far away   and  the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up  the reeds and flags shall wither  
7	the paper reeds by the brooks  by the mouth of the brooks  and every thing sown by the brooks  shall wither  be driven away  and be no  more   
8	the fishers also shall mourn  and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament  and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish  
9	moreover they that work in fine flax  and they that weave networks  shall be confounded  
10	and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof  all that make sluices  and  ponds for fish  
11	surely the princes of zoan  are  fools  the counsel of the wise counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish  how say ye unto pharaoh  i  am  the son of the wise  the son of ancient kings  
12	where  are  they  where  are  thy wise  men   and let them tell thee now  and let them know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt  
13	the princes of zoan are become fools  the princes of noph are deceived  they have also seduced egypt   even they that are  the stay of the tribes thereof  
14	the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof  and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof  as a drunken  man  staggereth in his vomit  
15	neither shall there be  any  work for egypt  which the head or tail  branch or rush  may do  
16	in that day shall egypt be like unto women  and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts  which he shaketh over it  
17	and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt  every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself  because of the counsel of the lord of hosts  which he hath determined against it  
18 	in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan  and swear to the lord of hosts  one shall be called  the city of destruction  
19	in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt  and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord  
20	and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt  for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors  and he shall send them a saviour  and a great one  and he shall deliver them  
21	and the lord shall be known to egypt  and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day  and shall do sacrifice and oblation  yea  they shall vow a vow unto the lord  and perform  it   
22	and the lord shall smite egypt  he shall smite and heal  it   and they shall return  even  to the lord  and he shall be intreated of them  and shall heal them  
23	in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria  and the assyrian shall come into egypt  and the egyptian into assyria  and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians  
24	in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria   even  a blessing in the midst of the land  
25	whom the lord of hosts shall bless  saying  blessed  be  egypt my people  and assyria the work of my hands  and israel mine inheritance

1 	in the year that tartan came unto ashdod   when sargon the king of assyria sent him   and fought against ashdod  and took it  
2	at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz  saying  go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins  and put off thy shoe from thy foot  and he did so  walking naked and barefoot  
3	and the lord said  like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years  for  a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia  
4	so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners  and the ethiopians captives  young and old  naked and barefoot  even with  their  buttocks uncovered  to the shame of egypt  
5	and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation  and of egypt their glory  
6	and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day  behold  such  is  our expectation  whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria  and how shall we escape

1 	the burden of the desert of the sea  as whirlwinds in the south pass through   so  it cometh from the desert  from a terrible land  
2	a grievous vision is declared unto me  the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously  and the spoiler spoileth  go up  o elam  besiege  o media  all the sighing thereof have i made to cease  
3	therefore are my loins filled with pain  pangs have taken hold upon me  as the pangs of a woman that travaileth  i was bowed down at the hearing  of it   i was dismayed at the seeing  of it   
4	my heart panted  fearfulness affrighted me  the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me  
5	prepare the table  watch in the watchtower  eat  drink  arise  ye princes   and  anoint the shield  
6	for thus hath the lord said unto me  go  set a watchman  let him declare what he seeth  
7	and he saw a chariot  with  a couple of horsemen  a chariot of asses   and  a chariot of camels  and he hearkened diligently with much heed  
8	and he cried  a lion  my lord  i stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime  and i am set in my ward whole nights  
9	and  behold  here cometh a chariot of men   with  a couple of horsemen  and he answered and said  babylon is fallen  is fallen  and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground  
10	o my threshing  and the corn of my floor  that which i have heard of the lord of hosts  the god of israel  have i declared unto you  
11 	the burden of dumah  he calleth to me out of seir  watchman  what of the night  watchman  what of the night  
12	the watchman said  the morning cometh  and also the night  if ye will enquire  enquire ye  return  come  
13 	the burden upon arabia  in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge  o ye travelling companies of dedanim  
14	the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that was thirsty  they prevented with their bread him that fled  
15	for they fled from the swords  from the drawn sword  and from the bent bow  and from the grievousness of war  
16	for thus hath the lord said unto me  within a year  according to the years of an hireling  and all the glory of kedar shall fail  
17	and the residue of the number of archers  the mighty men of the children of kedar  shall be diminished  for the lord god of israel hath spoken  it

1 	the burden of the valley of vision  what aileth thee now  that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops  
2	thou that art full of stirs  a tumultuous city  a joyous city  thy slain  men are  not slain with the sword  nor dead in battle  
3	all thy rulers are fled together  they are bound by the archers  all that are found in thee are bound together   which  have fled from far  
4	therefore said i  look away from me  i will weep bitterly  labour not to comfort me  because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people  
5	for  it is  a day of trouble  and of treading down  and of perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision  breaking down the walls  and of crying to the mountains  
6	and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men  and  horsemen  and kir uncovered the shield  
7	and it shall come to pass   that  thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots  and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate  
8 	and he discovered the covering of judah  and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest  
9	ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david  that they are many  and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool  
10	and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem  and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall  
11	ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool  but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof  neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago  
12	and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping  and to mourning  and to baldness  and to girding with sackcloth  
13	and behold joy and gladness  slaying oxen  and killing sheep  eating flesh  and drinking wine  let us eat and drink  for to morrow we shall die  
14	and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts  surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die  saith the lord god of hosts  
15 	thus saith the lord god of hosts  go  get thee unto this treasurer   even  unto shebna  which  is  over the house   and say   
16	what hast thou here  and whom hast thou here  that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here   as  he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high   and  that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock  
17	behold  the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity  and will surely cover thee  
18	he will surely violently turn and toss thee  like  a ball into a large country  there shalt thou die  and there the chariots of thy glory  shall be  the shame of thy lord s house  
19	and i will drive thee from thy station  and from thy state shall he pull thee down  
20	and it shall come to pass in that day  that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah  
21	and i will clothe him with thy robe  and strengthen him with thy girdle  and i will commit thy government into his hand  and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem  and to the house of judah  
22	and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder  so he shall open  and none shall shut  and he shall shut  and none shall open  
23	and i will fasten him  as  a nail in a sure place  and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father s house  
24	and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father s house  the offspring and the issue  all vessels of small quantity  from the vessels of cups  even to all the vessels of flagons  
25	in that day  saith the lord of hosts  shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed  and be cut down  and fall  and the burden that  was  upon it shall be cut off  for the lord hath spoken  it

1 	the burden of tyre  howl  ye ships of tarshish  for it is laid waste  so that there is no house  no entering in  from the land of chittim it is revealed to them

3	and by great waters the seed of sihor  the harvest of the river   is  her revenue  and she is a mart of nations  
4	be thou ashamed  o zidon  for the sea hath spoken   even  the strength of the sea  saying  i travail not  nor bring forth children  neither do i nourish up young men   nor  bring up virgins  
5	as at the report concerning egypt   so  shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre  
6	pass ye over to tarshish  howl  ye inhabitants of the isle  
7	 is  this your joyous  city   whose antiquity  is  of ancient days  her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn  
8	who hath taken this counsel against tyre  the crowning  city   whose merchants  are  princes  whose traffickers  are  the honourable of the earth  
9	the lord of hosts hath purposed it  to stain the pride of all glory   and  to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth  
10	pass through thy land as a river  o daughter of tarshish   there is  no more strength  
11	he stretched out his hand over the sea  he shook the kingdoms  the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant  city   to destroy the strong holds thereof  
12	and he said  thou shalt no more rejoice  o thou oppressed virgin  daughter of zidon  arise  pass over to chittim  there also shalt thou have no rest  
13	behold the land of the chaldeans  this people was not   till  the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness  they set up the towers thereof  they raised up the palaces thereof   and  he brought it to ruin  
14	howl  ye ships of tarshish  for your strength is laid waste  
15 	and it shall come to pass in that day  that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years  according to the days of one king  after the end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot  
16	take an harp  go about the city  thou harlot that hast been forgotten  make sweet melody  sing many songs  that thou mayest be remembered  
17	and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years  that the lord will visit tyre  and she shall turn to her hire  and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth  
18	and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord  it shall not be treasured nor laid up  for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord  to eat sufficiently  and for durable clothing

1 	behold  the lord maketh the earth empty  and maketh it waste  and turneth it upside down  and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof  
2	and it shall be  as with the people  so with the priest  as with the servant  so with his master  as with the maid  so with her mistress  as with the buyer  so with the seller  as with the lender  so with the borrower  as with the taker of usury  so with the giver of usury to him  
3	the land shall be utterly emptied  and utterly spoiled  for the lord hath spoken this word  
4	the earth mourneth  and  fadeth away  the world languisheth  and  fadeth away  the haughty people of the earth do languish  
5	the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof  because they have transgressed the laws  changed the ordinance  broken the everlasting covenant  
6	therefore hath the curse devoured the earth  and they that dwell therein are desolate  therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned  and few men left  
7	the new wine mourneth  the vine languisheth  all the merryhearted do sigh  
8	the mirth of tabrets ceaseth  the noise of them that rejoice endeth  the joy of the harp ceaseth  
9	they shall not drink wine with a song  strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it  
10	the city of confusion is broken down  every house is shut up  that no man may come in  
11	 there is  a crying for wine in the streets  all joy is darkened  the mirth of the land is gone  
12	in the city is left desolation  and the gate is smitten with destruction  
13 	when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people   there shall be  as the shaking of an olive tree   and  as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done  
14	they shall lift up their voice  they shall sing for the majesty of the lord  they shall cry aloud from the sea  
15	wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires   even  the name of the lord god of israel in the isles of the sea  
16 	from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs   even  glory to the righteous  but i said  my leanness  my leanness  woe unto me  the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously  yea  the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously  
17	fear  and the pit  and the snare   are  upon thee  o inhabitant of the earth  
18	and it shall come to pass   that  he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit  and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare  for the windows from on high are open  and the foundations of the earth do shake  
19	the earth is utterly broken down  the earth is clean dissolved  the earth is moved exceedingly  
20	the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard  and shall be removed like a cottage  and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it  and it shall fall  and not rise again  
21	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the lord shall punish the host of the high ones  that are  on high  and the kings of the earth upon the earth  
22	and they shall be gathered together   as  prisoners are gathered in the pit  and shall be shut up in the prison  and after many days shall they be visited  
23	then the moon shall be confounded  and the sun ashamed  when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion  and in jerusalem  and before his ancients gloriously

1 	o lord  thou  art  my god  i will exalt thee  i will praise thy name  for thou hast done wonderful  things  thy  counsels of old  are  faithfulness  and  truth  
2	for thou hast made of a city an heap   of  a defenced city a ruin  a palace of strangers to be no city  it shall never be built  
3	therefore shall the strong people glorify thee  the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee  
4	for thou hast been a strength to the poor  a strength to the needy in his distress  a refuge from the storm  a shadow from the heat  when the blast of the terrible ones  is  as a storm  against  the wall  
5	thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers  as the heat in a dry place   even  the heat with the shadow of a cloud  the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low  
6 	and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things  a feast of wines on the lees  of fat things full of marrow  of wines on the lees well refined  
7	and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people  and the vail that is spread over all nations  
8	he will swallow up death in victory  and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces  and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth  for the lord hath spoken  it   
9 	and it shall be said in that day  lo  this  is  our god  we have waited for him  and he will save us  this  is  the lord  we have waited for him  we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation  
10	for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest  and moab shall be trodden down under him  even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill  
11	and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them  as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth  his hands  to swim  and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands  
12	and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down  lay low   and  bring to the ground   even  to the dust  
isaiah 26
1 	in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah  we have a strong city  salvation will  god  appoint  for  walls and bulwarks  
2	open ye the gates  that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in  
3	thou wilt keep  him  in perfect peace   whose  mind  is  stayed  on thee   because he trusteth in thee  
4	trust ye in the lord for ever  for in the lord jehovah  is  everlasting strength  
5 	for he bringeth down them that dwell on high  the lofty city  he layeth it low  he layeth it low   even  to the ground  he bringeth it  even  to the dust  
6	the foot shall tread it down   even  the feet of the poor   and  the steps of the needy  
7	the way of the just  is  uprightness  thou  most upright  dost weigh the path of the just  
8	yea  in the way of thy judgments  o lord  have we waited for thee  the desire of  our  soul  is  to thy name  and to the remembrance of thee  
9	with my soul have i desired thee in the night  yea  with my spirit within me will i seek thee early  for when thy judgments  are  in the earth  the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness  
10	let favour be shewed to the wicked   yet  will he not learn righteousness  in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly  and will not behold the majesty of the lord  
11	lord   when  thy hand is lifted up  they will not see   but  they shall see  and be ashamed for  their  envy at the people  yea  the fire of thine enemies shall devour them  
12 	lord  thou wilt ordain peace for us  for thou also hast wrought all our works in us  
13	o lord our god   other  lords beside thee have had dominion over us   but  by thee only will we make mention of thy name  
14	 they are  dead  they shall not live   they are  deceased  they shall not rise  therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them  and made all their memory to perish  
15	thou hast increased the nation  o lord  thou hast increased the nation  thou art glorified  thou hadst removed  it  far  unto  all the ends of the earth  
16	lord  in trouble have they visited thee  they poured out a prayer  when  thy chastening  was  upon them  
17	like as a woman with child   that  draweth near the time of her delivery  is in pain   and  crieth out in her pangs  so have we been in thy sight  o lord  
18	we have been with child  we have been in pain  we have as it were brought forth wind  we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth  neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen  
19	thy dead  men  shall live   together with  my dead body shall they arise  awake and sing  ye that dwell in dust  for thy dew  is as  the dew of herbs  and the earth shall cast out the dead  
20 	come  my people  enter thou into thy chambers  and shut thy doors about thee  hide thyself as it were for a little moment  until the indignation be overpast  
21	for  behold  the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity  the earth also shall disclose her blood  and shall no more cover her slain  
isaiah 27
1 	in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent  even leviathan that crooked serpent  and he shall slay the dragon that  is  in the sea  
2	in that day sing ye unto her  a vineyard of red wine  
3	i the lord do keep it  i will water it every moment  lest  any  hurt it  i will keep it night and day  
4	fury  is  not in me  who would set the briers  and  thorns against me in battle  i would go through them  i would burn them together  
5	or let him take hold of my strength   that  he may make peace with me   and  he shall make peace with me  
6	he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root  israel shall blossom and bud  and fill the face of the world with fruit  
7 	hath he smitten him  as he smote those that smote him   or  is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him  
8	in measure  when it shooteth forth  thou wilt debate with it  he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind  
9	by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged  and this  is  all the fruit to take away his sin  when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder  the groves and images shall not stand up  
10	yet the defenced city  shall be  desolate   and  the habitation forsaken  and left like a wilderness  there shall the calf feed  and there shall he lie down  and consume the branches thereof  
11	when the boughs thereof are withered  they shall be broken off  the women come   and  set them on fire  for it  is  a people of no understanding  therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them  and he that formed them will shew them no favour  
12	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt  and ye shall be gathered one by one  o ye children of israel  
13	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the great trumpet shall be blown  and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria  and the outcasts in the land of egypt  and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem  
isaiah 28
1 	woe to the crown of pride  to the drunkards of ephraim  whose glorious beauty  is  a fading flower  which  are  on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine  
2	behold  the lord hath a mighty and strong one   which  as a tempest of hail  and  a destroying storm  as a flood of mighty waters overflowing  shall cast down to the earth with the hand  
3	the crown of pride  the drunkards of ephraim  shall be trodden under feet  
4	and the glorious beauty  which  is  on the head of the fat valley  shall be a fading flower   and  as the hasty fruit before the summer  which  when  he that looketh upon it seeth  while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up  
5	in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory  and for a diadem of beauty  unto the residue of his people  
6	and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment  and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate  
7	but they also have erred through wine  and through strong drink are out of the way  the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink  they are swallowed up of wine  they are out of the way through strong drink  they err in vision  they stumble  in  judgment  
8	for all tables are full of vomit  and  filthiness   so that there is  no place  clean   
9 	whom shall he teach knowledge  and whom shall he make to understand doctrine   them that are  weaned from the milk   and  drawn from the breasts  
10	for precept  must be  upon precept  precept upon precept  line upon line  line upon line  here a little   and  there a little  
11	for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people  
12	to whom he said  this  is  the rest  wherewith  ye may cause the weary to rest  and this  is  the refreshing  yet they would not hear  
13	but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept  precept upon precept  line upon line  line upon line  here a little   and  there a little  that they might go  and fall backward  and be broken  and snared  and taken  
14 	wherefore hear the word of the lord  ye scornful men  that rule this people which  is  in jerusalem  
15	because ye have said  we have made a covenant with death  and with hell are we at agreement  when the overflowing scourge shall pass through  it shall not come unto us  for we have made lies our refuge  and under falsehood have we hid ourselves  
16	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i lay in zion for a foundation a stone  a tried stone  a precious corner  stone   a sure foundation  he that believeth shall not make haste  
17	judgment also will i lay to the line  and righteousness to the plummet  and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies  and the waters shall overflow the hiding place  
18	and your covenant with death shall be disannulled  and your agreement with hell shall not stand  when the overflowing scourge shall pass through  then ye shall be trodden down by it  
19	from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you  for morning by morning shall it pass over  by day and by night  and it shall be a vexation only  to  understand the report  
20	for the bed is shorter than that  a man  can stretch himself  on it   and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself  in it   
21	for the lord shall rise up as  in  mount perazim  he shall be wroth as  in  the valley of gibeon  that he may do his work  his strange work  and bring to pass his act  his strange act  
22	now therefore be ye not mockers  lest your bands be made strong  for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption  even determined upon the whole earth  
23 	give ye ear  and hear my voice  hearken  and hear my speech  
24	doth the plowman plow all day to sow  doth he open and break the clods of his ground  
25	when he hath made plain the face thereof  doth he not cast abroad the fitches  and scatter the cummin  and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place  
26	for his god doth instruct him to discretion   and  doth teach him  
27	for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument  neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin  but the fitches are beaten out with a staff  and the cummin with a rod  
28	bread  corn  is bruised  because he will not ever be threshing it  nor break  it with  the wheel of his cart  nor bruise it  with  his horsemen  
29	this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts   which  is wonderful in counsel   and  excellent in working  
isaiah 29
1 	woe to ariel  to ariel  the city  where  david dwelt  add ye year to year  let them kill sacrifices  
2	yet i will distress ariel  and there shall be heaviness and sorrow  and it shall be unto me as ariel  
3	and i will camp against thee round about  and will lay siege against thee with a mount  and i will raise forts against thee  
4	and thou shalt be brought down   and  shalt speak out of the ground  and thy speech shall be low out of the dust  and thy voice shall be  as of one that hath a familiar spirit  out of the ground  and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust  
5	moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust  and the multitude of the terrible ones  shall be  as chaff that passeth away  yea  it shall be at an instant suddenly  
6	thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder  and with earthquake  and great noise  with storm and tempest  and the flame of devouring fire  
7	and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel  even all that fight against her and her munition  and that distress her  shall be as a dream of a night vision  
8	it shall even be as when an hungry  man  dreameth  and  behold  he eateth  but he awaketh  and his soul is empty  or as when a thirsty man dreameth  and  behold  he drinketh  but he awaketh  and  behold   he is  faint  and his soul hath appetite  so shall the multitude of all the nations be  that fight against mount zion  
9 	stay yourselves  and wonder  cry ye out  and cry  they are drunken  but not with wine  they stagger  but not with strong drink  
10	for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep  and hath closed your eyes  the prophets and your rulers  the seers hath he covered  
11	and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed  which  men  deliver to one that is learned  saying  read this  i pray thee  and he saith  i cannot  for it  is  sealed  
12	and the book is delivered to him that is not learned  saying  read this  i pray thee  and he saith  i am not learned  
13	wherefore the lord said  forasmuch as this people draw near  me  with their mouth  and with their lips do honour me  but have removed their heart far from me  and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men  
14	therefore  behold  i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people   even  a marvellous work and a wonder  for the wisdom of their wise  men  shall perish  and the understanding of their prudent  men  shall be hid  
15	woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord  and their works are in the dark  and they say  who seeth us  and who knoweth us  
16	surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter s clay  for shall the work say of him that made it  he made me not  or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it  he had no understanding  
17 	 is  it not yet a very little while  and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field  and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest  
18	and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book  and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity  and out of darkness  
19	the meek also shall increase  their  joy in the lord  and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel  
20	for the terrible one is brought to nought  and the scorner is consumed  and all that watch for iniquity are cut off  
21	that make a man an offender for a word  and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate  and turn aside the just for a thing of nought  
22	therefore thus saith the lord  who redeemed abraham  concerning the house of jacob  jacob shall not now be ashamed  neither shall his face now wax pale  
23	but when he seeth his children  the work of mine hands  in the midst of him  they shall sanctify my name  and sanctify the holy one of jacob  and shall fear the god of israel  
24	they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding  and they that murmured shall learn doctrine  
isaiah 30
1 	woe to the rebellious children  saith the lord  that take counsel  but not of me  and that cover with a covering  but not of my spirit  that they may add sin to sin  
2	that walk to go down into egypt  and have not asked at my mouth  to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh  and to trust in the shadow of egypt  
3	therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame  and the trust in the shadow of egypt  your  confusion  
4	for his princes were at zoan  and his ambassadors came to hanes  
5	they were all ashamed of a people  that  could not profit them  nor be an help nor profit  but a shame  and also a reproach  
6	the burden of the beasts of the south  into the land of trouble and anguish  from whence  come  the young and old lion  the viper and fiery flying serpent  they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses  and their treasures upon the bunches of camels  to a people  that  shall not profit  them   
7	for the egyptians shall help in vain  and to no purpose  therefore have i cried concerning this  their strength  is  to sit still  
8 	now go  write it before them in a table  and note it in a book  that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever  
9	that this  is  a rebellious people  lying children  children  that  will not hear the law of the lord  
10	which say to the seers  see not  and to the prophets  prophesy not unto us right things  speak unto us smooth things  prophesy deceits  
11	get you out of the way  turn aside out of the path  cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us  
12	wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel  because ye despise this word  and trust in oppression and perverseness  and stay thereon  
13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall  swelling out in a high wall  whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant  
14	and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters  vessel that is broken in pieces  he shall not spare  so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth  or to take water  withal  out of the pit  
15	for thus saith the lord god  the holy one of israel  in returning and rest shall ye be saved  in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength  and ye would not  
16	but ye said  no  for we will flee upon horses  therefore shall ye flee  and  we will ride upon the swift  therefore shall they that pursue you be swift  
17	one thousand  shall flee  at the rebuke of one  at the rebuke of five shall ye flee  till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain  and as an ensign on an hill  
18 	and therefore will the lord wait  that he may be gracious unto you  and therefore will he be exalted  that he may have mercy upon you  for the lord  is  a god of judgment  blessed  are  all they that wait for him  
19	for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem  thou shalt weep no more  he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry  when he shall hear it  he will answer thee  
20	and  though  the lord give you the bread of adversity  and the water of affliction  yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more  but thine eyes shall see thy teachers  
21	and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee  saying  this  is  the way  walk ye in it  when ye turn to the right hand  and when ye turn to the left  
22	ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver  and the ornament of thy molten images of gold  thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth  thou shalt say unto it  get thee hence  
23	then shall he give the rain of thy seed  that thou shalt sow the ground withal  and bread of the increase of the earth  and it shall be fat and plenteous  in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures  
24	the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender  which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan  
25	and there shall be upon every high mountain  and upon every high hill  rivers  and  streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter  when the towers fall  
26	moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun  and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold  as the light of seven days  in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people  and healeth the stroke of their wound  
27 	behold  the name of the lord cometh from far  burning  with  his anger  and the burden  thereof is  heavy  his lips are full of indignation  and his tongue as a devouring fire  
28	and his breath  as an overflowing stream  shall reach to the midst of the neck  to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity  and  there shall be  a bridle in the jaws of the people  causing  them  to err  
29	ye shall have a song  as in the night  when  a holy solemnity is kept  and gladness of heart  as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord  to the mighty one of israel  
30	and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard  and shall shew the lighting down of his arm  with the indignation of  his  anger  and  with  the flame of a devouring fire   with  scattering  and tempest  and hailstones  
31	for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down   which  smote with a rod  
32	and  in  every place where the grounded staff shall pass  which the lord shall lay upon him   it  shall be with tabrets and harps  and in battles of shaking will he fight with it  
33	for tophet  is  ordained of old  yea  for the king it is prepared  he hath made  it  deep  and  large  the pile thereof  is  fire and much wood  the breath of the lord  like a stream of brimstone  doth kindle it  
isaiah 31
1 	woe to them that go down to egypt for help  and stay on horses  and trust in chariots  because  they are  many  and in horsemen  because they are very strong  but they look not unto the holy one of israel  neither seek the lord  
2	yet he also  is  wise  and will bring evil  and will not call back his words  but will arise against the house of the evildoers  and against the help of them that work iniquity  
3	now the egyptians  are  men  and not god  and their horses flesh  and not spirit  when the lord shall stretch out his hand  both he that helpeth shall fall  and he that is holpen shall fall down  and they all shall fail together  
4	for thus hath the lord spoken unto me  like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey  when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him   he  will not be afraid of their voice  nor abase himself for the noise of them  so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion  and for the hill thereof  
5	as birds flying  so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem  defending also he will deliver  it  and  passing over he will preserve it  
6 	turn ye unto  him from  whom the children of israel have deeply revolted  
7	for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver  and his idols of gold  which your own hands have made unto you  for  a sin  
8	then shall the assyrian fall with the sword  not of a mighty man  and the sword  not of a mean man  shall devour him  but he shall flee from the sword  and his young men shall be discomfited  
9	and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear  and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign  saith the lord  whose fire  is  in zion  and his furnace in jerusalem  
isaiah 32
1 	behold  a king shall reign in righteousness  and princes shall rule in judgment  
2	and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind  and a covert from the tempest  as rivers of water in a dry place  as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land  
3	and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim  and the ears of them that hear shall hearken  
4	the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge  and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly  
5	the vile person shall be no more called liberal  nor the churl said  to be  bountiful  
6	for the vile person will speak villany  and his heart will work iniquity  to practise hypocrisy  and to utter error against the lord  to make empty the soul of the hungry  and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail  
7	the instruments also of the churl  are  evil  he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words  even when the needy speaketh right  
8	but the liberal deviseth liberal things  and by liberal things shall he stand  
9 	rise up  ye women that are at ease  hear my voice  ye careless daughters  give ear unto my speech  
10	many days and years shall ye be troubled  ye careless women  for the vintage shall fail  the gathering shall not come  
11	tremble  ye women that are at ease  be troubled  ye careless ones  strip you  and make you bare  and gird  sackcloth  upon  your  loins  
12	they shall lament for the teats  for the pleasant fields  for the fruitful vine  
13	upon the land of my people shall come up thorns  and  briers  yea  upon all the houses of joy  in  the joyous city  
14	because the palaces shall be forsaken  the multitude of the city shall be left  the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever  a joy of wild asses  a pasture of flocks  
15	until the spirit be poured upon us from on high  and the wilderness be a fruitful field  and the fruitful field be counted for a forest  
16	then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness  and righteousness remain in the fruitful field  
17	and the work of righteousness shall be peace  and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever  
18	and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation  and in sure dwellings  and in quiet resting places  
19	when it shall hail  coming down on the forest  and the city shall be low in a low place  
20	blessed  are  ye that sow beside all waters  that send forth  thither  the feet of the ox and the ass  
isaiah 33
1 	woe to thee that spoilest  and thou  wast  not spoiled  and dealest treacherously  and they dealt not treacherously with thee  when thou shalt cease to spoil  thou shalt be spoiled   and  when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously  they shall deal treacherously with thee  
2	o lord  be gracious unto us  we have waited for thee  be thou their arm every morning  our salvation also in the time of trouble  
3	at the noise of the tumult the people fled  at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered  
4	and your spoil shall be gathered  like  the gathering of the caterpiller  as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them  
5	the lord is exalted  for he dwelleth on high  he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness  
6	and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times   and  strength of salvation  the fear of the lord  is  his treasure  
7	behold  their valiant ones shall cry without  the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly  
8	the highways lie waste  the wayfaring man ceaseth  he hath broken the covenant  he hath despised the cities  he regardeth no man  
9	the earth mourneth  and  languisheth  lebanon is ashamed  and  hewn down  sharon is like a wilderness  and bashan and carmel shake off  their fruits   
10	now will i rise  saith the lord  now will i be exalted  now will i lift up myself  
11	ye shall conceive chaff  ye shall bring forth stubble  your breath   as  fire  shall devour you  
12	and the people shall be  as  the burnings of lime   as  thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire  
13 	hear  ye  that are  far off  what i have done  and  ye  that are  near  acknowledge my might  
14	the sinners in zion are afraid  fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites  who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire  who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings  
15	he that walketh righteously  and speaketh uprightly  he that despiseth the gain of oppressions  that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes  that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood  and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil  
16	he shall dwell on high  his place of defence  shall be  the munitions of rocks  bread shall be given him  his waters  shall be  sure  
17	thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty  they shall behold the land that is very far off  
18	thine heart shall meditate terror  where  is  the scribe  where  is  the receiver  where  is  he that counted the towers  
19	thou shalt not see a fierce people  a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive  of a stammering tongue   that thou canst  not understand  
20	look upon zion  the city of our solemnities  thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation  a tabernacle  that  shall not be taken down  not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed  neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken  
21	but there the glorious lord  will be  unto us a place of broad rivers  and  streams  wherein shall go no galley with oars  neither shall gallant ship pass thereby  
22	for the lord  is  our judge  the lord  is  our lawgiver  the lord  is  our king  he will save us  
23	thy tacklings are loosed  they could not well strengthen their mast  they could not spread the sail  then is the prey of a great spoil divided  the lame take the prey  
24	and the inhabitant shall not say  i am sick  the people that dwell therein  shall be  forgiven  their  iniquity  
isaiah 34
1 	come near  ye nations  to hear  and hearken  ye people  let the earth hear  and all that is therein  the world  and all things that come forth of it  
2	for the indignation of the lord  is  upon all nations  and  his  fury upon all their armies  he hath utterly destroyed them  he hath delivered them to the slaughter  
3	their slain also shall be cast out  and their stink shall come up out of their carcases  and the mountains shall be melted with their blood  
4	and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved  and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll  and all their host shall fall down  as the leaf falleth off from the vine  and as a falling  fig  from the fig tree  
5	for my sword shall be bathed in heaven  behold  it shall come down upon idumea  and upon the people of my curse  to judgment  
6	the sword of the lord is filled with blood  it is made fat with fatness   and  with the blood of lambs and goats  with the fat of the kidneys of rams  for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah  and a great slaughter in the land of idumea  
7	and the unicorns shall come down with them  and the bullocks with the bulls  and their land shall be soaked with blood  and their dust made fat with fatness  
8	for  it is  the day of the lord s vengeance   and  the year of recompences for the controversy of zion  
9 	and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch  and the dust thereof into brimstone  and the land thereof shall become burning pitch  
10	it shall not be quenched night nor day  the smoke thereof shall go up for ever  from generation to generation it shall lie waste  none shall pass through it for ever and ever  
11	but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it  the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it  and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion  and the stones of emptiness  
12	they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom  but none  shall be  there  and all her princes shall be nothing  
13	and thorns shall come up in her palaces  nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof  and it shall be an habitation of dragons   and  a court for owls  
14	the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island  and the satyr shall cry to his fellow  the screech owl also shall rest there  and find for herself a place of rest  
15	there shall the great owl make her nest  and lay  and hatch  and gather under her shadow  there shall the vultures also be gathered  every one with her mate  
16	seek ye out of the book of the lord  and read  no one of these shall fail  none shall want her mate  for my mouth it hath commanded  and his spirit it hath gathered them  
17	and he hath cast the lot for them  and his hand hath divided it unto them by line  they shall possess it for ever  from generation to generation shall they dwell therein  
isaiah 35
1 	the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them  and the desert shall rejoice  and blossom as the rose  
2	it shall blossom abundantly  and rejoice even with joy and singing  the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it  the excellency of carmel and sharon  they shall see the glory of the lord   and  the excellency of our god  
3	strengthen ye the weak hands  and confirm the feeble knees  
4	say to them  that are  of a fearful heart  be strong  fear not  behold  your god will come  with  vengeance   even  god  with  a recompence  he will come and save you  
5 	then the eyes of the blind shall be opened  and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped  
6	then shall the lame  man  leap as an hart  and the tongue of the dumb sing  for in the wilderness shall waters break out  and streams in the desert  
7	and the parched ground shall become a pool  and the thirsty land springs of water  in the habitation of dragons  where each lay   shall be  grass with reeds and rushes  
8	and an highway shall be there  and a way  and it shall be called the way of holiness  the unclean shall not pass over it  but it  shall be  for those  the wayfaring men  though fools  shall not err  therein   
9	no lion shall be there  nor  any  ravenous beast shall go up thereon  it shall not be found there  but the redeemed shall walk  there   
10	and the ransomed of the lord shall return  and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads  they shall obtain joy and gladness  and sorrow and sighing shall flee away  
isaiah 36
1 	now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah   that  sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah  and took them  
2	and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army  and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field  
3	then came forth unto him eliakim  hilkiah s son  which was over the house  and shebna the scribe  and joah  asaph s son  the recorder  
4	and rabshakeh said unto them  say ye now to hezekiah  thus saith the great king  the king of assyria  what confidence  is  this wherein thou trustest  
5	i say   sayest thou    but  they are but  vain words   i have  counsel and strength for war  now on whom dost thou trust  that thou rebellest against me  
6	lo  thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed  on egypt  whereon if a man lean  it will go into his hand  and pierce it  so  is  pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him  
7	but if thou say to me  we trust in the lord our god   is it  not he  whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away  and said to judah and to jerusalem  ye shall worship before this altar  
8	now therefore give pledges  i pray thee  to my master the king of assyria  and i will give thee two thousand horses  if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them  
9	how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants  and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen  
10	and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it  the lord said unto me  go up against this land  and destroy it  
11 	then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh  speak  i pray thee  unto thy servants in the syrian language  for we understand  it   and speak not to us in the jews  language  in the ears of the people that  are  on the wall  
12	but rabshakeh said  hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words   hath he  not  sent me  to the men that sit upon the wall  that they may eat their own dung  and drink their own piss with you  
13	then rabshakeh stood  and cried with a loud voice in the jews  language  and said  hear ye the words of the great king  the king of assyria  
14	thus saith the king  let not hezekiah deceive you  for he shall not be able to deliver you  
15	neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord  saying  the lord will surely deliver us  this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria  
16	hearken not to hezekiah  for thus saith the king of assyria  make  an agreement  with me  by  a present  and come out to me  and eat ye every one of his vine  and every one of his fig tree  and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern  
17	until i come and take you away to a land like your own land  a land of corn and wine  a land of bread and vineyards  
18	 beware  lest hezekiah persuade you  saying  the lord will deliver us  hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria  
19	where  are  the gods of hamath and arphad  where  are  the gods of sepharvaim  and have they delivered samaria out of my hand  
20	who  are they  among all the gods of these lands  that have delivered their land out of my hand  that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand  
21	but they held their peace  and answered him not a word  for the king s commandment was  saying  answer him not  
22	then came eliakim  the son of hilkiah  that  was  over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah  the son of asaph  the recorder  to hezekiah with  their  clothes rent  and told him the words of rabshakeh  
isaiah 37
1 	and it came to pass  when king hezekiah heard  it   that he rent his clothes  and covered himself with sackcloth  and went into the house of the lord  
2	and he sent eliakim  who  was  over the household  and shebna the scribe  and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth  unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz  
3	and they said unto him  thus saith hezekiah  this day  is  a day of trouble  and of rebuke  and of blasphemy  for the children are come to the birth  and  there is  not strength to bring forth  
4	it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh  whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god  and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard  wherefore lift up  thy  prayer for the remnant that is left  
5	so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah  
6	and isaiah said unto them  thus shall ye say unto your master  thus saith the lord  be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard  wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me  
7	behold  i will send a blast upon him  and he shall hear a rumour  and return to his own land  and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land  
8 	so rabshakeh returned  and found the king of assyria warring against libnah  for he had heard that he was departed from lachish  
9	and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia  he is come forth to make war with thee  and when he heard  it   he sent messengers to hezekiah  saying  
10	thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah  saying  let not thy god  in whom thou trustest  deceive thee  saying  jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria  
11	behold  thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly  and shalt thou be delivered  
12	have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed   as  gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and the children of eden which  were  in telassar  
13	where  is  the king of hamath  and the king of arphad  and the king of the city of sepharvaim  hena  and ivah  
14	and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers  and read it  and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord  and spread it before the lord  
15	and hezekiah prayed unto the lord  saying  
16	o lord of hosts  god of israel  that dwellest  between  the cherubims  thou  art  the god   even  thou alone  of all the kingdoms of the earth  thou hast made heaven and earth  
17	incline thine ear  o lord  and hear  open thine eyes  o lord  and see  and hear all the words of sennacherib  which hath sent to reproach the living god  
18	of a truth  lord  the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations  and their countries  
19	and have cast their gods into the fire  for they  were  no gods  but the work of men s hands  wood and stone  therefore they have destroyed them  
20	now therefore  o lord our god  save us from his hand  that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou  art  the lord   even  thou only  
21 	then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah  saying  thus saith the lord god of israel  whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria  
22	this  is  the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him  the virgin  the daughter of zion  hath despised thee   and  laughed thee to scorn  the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee  
23	whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed  and against whom hast thou exalted  thy  voice  and lifted up thine eyes on high   even  against the holy one of israel  
24	by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord  and hast said  by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains  to the sides of lebanon  and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof   and  the choice fir trees thereof  and i will enter into the height of his border   and  the forest of his carmel  
25	i have digged  and drunk water  and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places  
26	hast thou not heard long ago   how  i have done it   and  of ancient times  that i have formed it  now have i brought it to pass  that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities  into  ruinous heaps  
27	therefore their inhabitants  were  of small power  they were dismayed and confounded  they were  as  the grass of the field  and  as  the green herb   as  the grass on the housetops  and  as corn  blasted before it be grown up  
28	but i know thy abode  and thy going out  and thy coming in  and thy rage against me  
29	because thy rage against me  and thy tumult  is come up into mine ears  therefore will i put my hook in thy nose  and my bridle in thy lips  and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest  
30	and this  shall be  a sign unto thee  ye shall eat  this  year such as groweth of itself  and the second year that which springeth of the same  and in the third year sow ye  and reap  and plant vineyards  and eat the fruit thereof  
31	and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward  and bear fruit upward  
32	for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant  and they that escape out of mount zion  the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this  
33	therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria  he shall not come into this city  nor shoot an arrow there  nor come before it with shields  nor cast a bank against it  
34	by the way that he came  by the same shall he return  and shall not come into this city  saith the lord  
35	for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake  and for my servant david s sake  
36	then the angel of the lord went forth  and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand  and when they arose early in the morning  behold  they  were  all dead corpses  
37	so sennacherib king of assyria departed  and went and returned  and dwelt at nineveh  
38	and it came to pass  as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god  that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword  and they escaped into the land of armenia  and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead  
isaiah 38
1 	in those days was hezekiah sick unto death  and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him  and said unto him  thus saith the lord  set thine house in order  for thou shalt die  and not live  
2	then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall  and prayed unto the lord  
3	and said  remember now  o lord  i beseech thee  how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart  and have done  that which is  good in thy sight  and hezekiah wept sore  
4	then came the word of the lord to isaiah  saying  
5	go  and say to hezekiah  thus saith the lord  the god of david thy father  i have heard thy prayer  i have seen thy tears  behold  i will add unto thy days fifteen years  
6	and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria  and i will defend this city  
7	and this  shall be  a sign unto thee from the lord  that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken  
8	behold  i will bring again the shadow of the degrees  which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz  ten degrees backward  so the sun returned ten degrees  by which degrees it was gone down  
9 	the writing of hezekiah king of judah  when he had been sick  and was recovered of his sickness  
10	i said in the cutting off of my days  i shall go to the gates of the grave  i am deprived of the residue of my years  
11	i said  i shall not see the lord   even  the lord  in the land of the living  i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world  
12	mine age is departed  and is removed from me as a shepherd s tent  i have cut off like a weaver my life  he will cut me off with pining sickness  from day  even  to night wilt thou make an end of me  
13	i reckoned till morning   that   as a lion  so will he break all my bones  from day  even  to night wilt thou make an end of me  
14	like a crane  or  a swallow  so did i chatter  i did mourn as a dove  mine eyes fail  with looking  upward  o lord  i am oppressed  undertake for me  
15	what shall i say  he hath both spoken unto me  and himself hath done  it   i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul  
16	o lord  by these  things men  live  and in all these  things is  the life of my spirit  so wilt thou recover me  and make me to live  
17	behold  for peace i had great bitterness  but thou hast in love to my soul  delivered it  from the pit of corruption  for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back  
18	for the grave cannot praise thee  death can  not  celebrate thee  they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth  
19	the living  the living  he shall praise thee  as i  do  this day  the father to the children shall make known thy truth  
20	the lord  was ready  to save me  therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord  
21	for isaiah had said  let them take a lump of figs  and lay  it  for a plaister upon the boil  and he shall recover  
22	hezekiah also had said  what  is  the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord  
isaiah 39
1 	at that time merodachbaladan  the son of baladan  king of babylon  sent letters and a present to hezekiah  for he had heard that he had been sick  and was recovered  
2	and hezekiah was glad of them  and shewed them the house of his precious things  the silver  and the gold  and the spices  and the precious ointment  and all the house of his armour  and all that was found in his treasures  there was nothing in his house  nor in all his dominion  that hezekiah shewed them not  
3	then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah  and said unto him  what said these men  and from whence came they unto thee  and hezekiah said  they are come from a far country unto me   even  from babylon  
4	then said he  what have they seen in thine house  and hezekiah answered  all that  is  in mine house have they seen  there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them  
5 	then said isaiah to hezekiah  hear the word of the lord of hosts  
6	behold  the days come  that all that  is  in thine house  and  that  which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day  shall be carried to babylon  nothing shall be left  saith the lord  
7	and of thy sons that shall issue from thee  which thou shalt beget  shall they take away  and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon  
8	then said hezekiah to isaiah  good  is  the word of the lord which thou hast spoken  he said moreover  for there shall be peace and truth in my days  
isaiah 40
1 	comfort ye  comfort ye my people  saith your god  
2	speak ye comfortably to jerusalem  and cry unto her  that her warfare is accomplished  that her iniquity is pardoned  for she hath received of the lord s hand double for all her sins  
3 	the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness  prepare ye the way of the lord  make straight in the desert a highway for our god  
4	every valley shall be exalted  and every mountain and hill shall be made low  and the crooked shall be made straight  and the rough places plain  
5	and the glory of the lord shall be revealed  and all flesh shall see  it  together  for the mouth of the lord hath spoken  it   
6	the voice said  cry  and he said  what shall i cry  all flesh  is  grass  and all the goodliness thereof  is  as the flower of the field  
7	the grass withereth  the flower fadeth  because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it  surely the people  is  grass  
8	the grass withereth  the flower fadeth  but the word of our god shall stand for ever  
9 	o zion  that bringest good tidings  get thee up into the high mountain  o jerusalem  that bringest good tidings  lift up thy voice with strength  lift  it  up  be not afraid  say unto the cities of judah  behold your god  
10	behold  the lord god will come with strong  hand   and his arm shall rule for him  behold  his reward  is  with him  and his work before him  
11	he shall feed his flock like a shepherd  he shall gather the lambs with his arm  and carry  them  in his bosom   and  shall gently lead those that are with young  
12 	who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand  and meted out heaven with the span  and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure  and weighed the mountains in scales  and the hills in a balance  
13	who hath directed the spirit of the lord  or  being  his counsellor hath taught him  
14	with whom took he counsel  and  who  instructed him  and taught him in the path of judgment  and taught him knowledge  and shewed to him the way of understanding  
15	behold  the nations  are  as a drop of a bucket  and are counted as the small dust of the balance  behold  he taketh up the isles as a very little thing  
16	and lebanon  is  not sufficient to burn  nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering  
17	all nations before him  are  as nothing  and they are counted to him less than nothing  and vanity  
18 	to whom then will ye liken god  or what likeness will ye compare unto him  
19	the workman melteth a graven image  and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold  and casteth silver chains  
20	he that  is  so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree  that  will not rot  he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image   that  shall not be moved  
21	have ye not known  have ye not heard  hath it not been told you from the beginning  have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth  
22	 it is  he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth  and the inhabitants thereof  are  as grasshoppers  that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain  and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in  
23	that bringeth the princes to nothing  he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity  
24	yea  they shall not be planted  yea  they shall not be sown  yea  their stock shall not take root in the earth  and he shall also blow upon them  and they shall wither  and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble  
25	to whom then will ye liken me  or shall i be equal  saith the holy one  
26	lift up your eyes on high  and behold who hath created these  things   that bringeth out their host by number  he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might  for that  he is  strong in power  not one faileth  
27 	why sayest thou  o jacob  and speakest  o israel  my way is hid from the lord  and my judgment is passed over from my god  
28	hast thou not known  hast thou not heard   that  the everlasting god  the lord  the creator of the ends of the earth  fainteth not  neither is weary   there is  no searching of his understanding  
29	he giveth power to the faint  and to  them that have  no might he increaseth strength  
30	even the youths shall faint and be weary  and the young men shall utterly fall  
31	but they that wait upon the lord shall renew  their  strength  they shall mount up with wings as eagles  they shall run  and not be weary   and  they shall walk  and not faint  
isaiah 41
1 	keep silence before me  o islands  and let the people renew  their  strength  let them come near  then let them speak  let us come near together to judgment  
2	who raised up the righteous  man  from the east  called him to his foot  gave the nations before him  and made  him  rule over kings  he gave  them  as the dust to his sword   and  as driven stubble to his bow  
3	he pursued them   and  passed safely   even  by the way  that  he had not gone with his feet  
4	who hath wrought and done  it   calling the generations from the beginning  i the lord  the first  and with the last  i  am  he  
5	the isles saw  it   and feared  the ends of the earth were afraid  drew near  and came  
6	they helped every one his neighbour  and  every one  said to his brother  be of good courage  
7	so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith   and  he that smootheth  with  the hammer him that smote the anvil  saying  it  is  ready for the sodering  and he fastened it with nails   that  it should not be moved  
8	but thou  israel   art  my servant  jacob whom i have chosen  the seed of abraham my friend  
9	 thou  whom i have taken from the ends of the earth  and called thee from the chief men thereof  and said unto thee  thou  art  my servant  i have chosen thee  and not cast thee away  
10 	fear thou not  for i  am  with thee  be not dismayed  for i  am  thy god  i will strengthen thee  yea  i will help thee  yea  i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness  
11	behold  all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded  they shall be as nothing  and they that strive with thee shall perish  
12	thou shalt seek them  and shalt not find them   even  them that contended with thee  they that war against thee shall be as nothing  and as a thing of nought  
13	for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand  saying unto thee  fear not  i will help thee  
14	fear not  thou worm jacob   and  ye men of israel  i will help thee  saith the lord  and thy redeemer  the holy one of israel  
15	behold  i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth  thou shalt thresh the mountains  and beat  them  small  and shalt make the hills as chaff  
16	thou shalt fan them  and the wind shall carry them away  and the whirlwind shall scatter them  and thou shalt rejoice in the lord   and  shalt glory in the holy one of israel  
17	 when  the poor and needy seek water  and  there is  none   and  their tongue faileth for thirst  i the lord will hear them  i the god of israel will not forsake them  
18	i will open rivers in high places  and fountains in the midst of the valleys  i will make the wilderness a pool of water  and the dry land springs of water  
19	i will plant in the wilderness the cedar  the shittah tree  and the myrtle  and the oil tree  i will set in the desert the fir tree   and  the pine  and the box tree together  
20	that they may see  and know  and consider  and understand together  that the hand of the lord hath done this  and the holy one of israel hath created it  
21 	produce your cause  saith the lord  bring forth your strong  reasons   saith the king of jacob  
22	let them bring  them  forth  and shew us what shall happen  let them shew the former things  what they  be   that we may consider them  and know the latter end of them  or declare us things for to come  
23	shew the things that are to come hereafter  that we may know that ye  are  gods  yea  do good  or do evil  that we may be dismayed  and behold  it  together  
24	behold  ye  are  of nothing  and your work of nought  an abomination  is he that  chooseth you  
25	i have raised up  one  from the north  and he shall come  from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name  and he shall come upon princes as  upon  morter  and as the potter treadeth clay  
26	who hath declared from the beginning  that we may know  and beforetime  that we may say   he is  righteous  yea   there is  none that sheweth  yea   there is  none that declareth  yea   there is  none that heareth your words  
27	the first  shall say  to zion  behold  behold them  and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings  
28	for i beheld  and  there was  no man  even among them  and  there was  no counsellor  that  when i asked of them  could answer a word  
29	behold  they  are  all vanity  their works  are  nothing  their molten images  are  wind and confusion  
isaiah 42
1 	behold my servant  whom i uphold  mine elect   in whom  my soul delighteth  i have put my spirit upon him  he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles  
2	he shall not cry  nor lift up  nor cause his voice to be heard in the street  
3	a bruised reed shall he not break  and the smoking flax shall he not quench  he shall bring forth judgment unto truth  
4	he shall not fail nor be discouraged  till he have set judgment in the earth  and the isles shall wait for his law  
5 	thus saith god the lord  he that created the heavens  and stretched them out  he that spread forth the earth  and that which cometh out of it  he that giveth breath unto the people upon it  and spirit to them that walk therein  
6	i the lord have called thee in righteousness  and will hold thine hand  and will keep thee  and give thee for a covenant of the people  for a light of the gentiles  
7	to open the blind eyes  to bring out the prisoners from the prison   and  them that sit in darkness out of the prison house  
8	i  am  the lord  that  is  my name  and my glory will i not give to another  neither my praise to graven images  
9	behold  the former things are come to pass  and new things do i declare  before they spring forth i tell you of them  
10	sing unto the lord a new song   and  his praise from the end of the earth  ye that go down to the sea  and all that is therein  the isles  and the inhabitants thereof  
11	let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up  their voice   the villages  that  kedar doth inhabit  let the inhabitants of the rock sing  let them shout from the top of the mountains  
12	let them give glory unto the lord  and declare his praise in the islands  
13 	the lord shall go forth as a mighty man  he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war  he shall cry  yea  roar  he shall prevail against his enemies  
14	i have long time holden my peace  i have been still   and  refrained myself   now  will i cry like a travailing woman  i will destroy and devour at once  
15	i will make waste mountains and hills  and dry up all their herbs  and i will make the rivers islands  and i will dry up the pools  
16	and i will bring the blind by a way  that  they knew not  i will lead them in paths  that  they have not known  i will make darkness light before them  and crooked things straight  these things will i do unto them  and not forsake them  
17	they shall be turned back  they shall be greatly ashamed  that trust in graven images  that say to the molten images  ye  are  our gods  
18 	hear  ye deaf  and look  ye blind  that ye may see  
19	who  is  blind  but my servant  or deaf  as my messenger  that  i sent  who  is  blind as  he that is  perfect  and blind as the lord s servant  
20	seeing many things  but thou observest not  opening the ears  but he heareth not  
21	the lord is well pleased for his righteousness  sake  he will magnify the law  and make  it  honourable  
22	but this  is  a people robbed and spoiled   they are  all of them snared in holes  and they are hid in prison houses  they are for a prey  and none delivereth  for a spoil  and none saith  restore  
23	who among you will give ear to this   who  will hearken and hear for the time to come  
24	who gave jacob for a spoil  and israel to the robbers  did not the lord  he against whom we have sinned  for they would not walk in his ways  neither were they obedient unto his law  
25	therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger  and the strength of battle  and it hath set him on fire round about  yet he knew not  and it burned him  yet he laid  it  not to heart  
isaiah 43
1 	but now thus saith the lord that created thee  o jacob  and he that formed thee  o israel  fear not  for i have redeemed thee  i have called  thee  by thy name  thou  art  mine  
2	when thou passest through the waters  i  will be  with thee  and through the rivers  they shall not overflow thee  when thou walkest through the fire  thou shalt not be burned  neither shall the flame kindle upon thee  
3	for i  am  the lord thy god  the holy one of israel  thy saviour  i gave egypt  for  thy ransom  ethiopia and seba for thee  
4	since thou wast precious in my sight  thou hast been honourable  and i have loved thee  therefore will i give men for thee  and people for thy life  
5	fear not  for i  am  with thee  i will bring thy seed from the east  and gather thee from the west  
6	i will say to the north  give up  and to the south  keep not back  bring my sons from far  and my daughters from the ends of the earth  
7	 even  every one that is called by my name  for i have created him for my glory  i have formed him  yea  i have made him  
8 	bring forth the blind people that have eyes  and the deaf that have ears  
9	let all the nations be gathered together  and let the people be assembled  who among them can declare this  and shew us former things  let them bring forth their witnesses  that they may be justified  or let them hear  and say   it is  truth  
10	ye  are  my witnesses  saith the lord  and my servant whom i have chosen  that ye may know and believe me  and understand that i  am  he  before me there was no god formed  neither shall there be after me  
11	i   even  i   am  the lord  and beside me  there is  no saviour  
12	i have declared  and have saved  and i have shewed  when  there was  no strange  god  among you  therefore ye  are  my witnesses  saith the lord  that i  am  god  
13	yea  before the day  was  i  am  he  and  there is  none that can deliver out of my hand  i will work  and who shall let it  
14 	thus saith the lord  your redeemer  the holy one of israel  for your sake i have sent to babylon  and have brought down all their nobles  and the chaldeans  whose cry  is  in the ships  
15	i  am  the lord  your holy one  the creator of israel  your king  
16	thus saith the lord  which maketh a way in the sea  and a path in the mighty waters  
17	which bringeth forth the chariot and horse  the army and the power  they shall lie down together  they shall not rise  they are extinct  they are quenched as tow  
18	remember ye not the former things  neither consider the things of old  
19	behold  i will do a new thing  now it shall spring forth  shall ye not know it  i will even make a way in the wilderness   and  rivers in the desert  
20	the beast of the field shall honour me  the dragons and the owls  because i give waters in the wilderness   and  rivers in the desert  to give drink to my people  my chosen  
21	this people have i formed for myself  they shall shew forth my praise  
22 	but thou hast not called upon me  o jacob  but thou hast been weary of me  o israel  
23	thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings  neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices  i have not caused thee to serve with an offering  nor wearied thee with incense  
24	thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money  neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices  but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins  thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities  
25	i   even  i   am  he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake  and will not remember thy sins  
26	put me in remembrance  let us plead together  declare thou  that thou mayest be justified  
27	thy first father hath sinned  and thy teachers have transgressed against me  
28	therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary  and have given jacob to the curse  and israel to reproaches  
isaiah 44
1 	yet now hear  o jacob my servant  and israel  whom i have chosen  
2	thus saith the lord that made thee  and formed thee from the womb   which  will help thee  fear not  o jacob  my servant  and thou  jesurun  whom i have chosen  
3	for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty  and floods upon the dry ground  i will pour my spirit upon thy seed  and my blessing upon thine offspring  
4	and they shall spring up  as  among the grass  as willows by the water courses  
5	one shall say  i  am  the lord s  and another shall call  himself  by the name of jacob  and another shall subscribe  with  his hand unto the lord  and surname  himself  by the name of israel  
6	thus saith the lord the king of israel  and his redeemer the lord of hosts  i  am  the first  and i  am  the last  and beside me  there is  no god  
7	and who  as i  shall call  and shall declare it  and set it in order for me  since i appointed the ancient people  and the things that are coming  and shall come  let them shew unto them  
8	fear ye not  neither be afraid  have not i told thee from that time  and have declared  it   ye  are  even my witnesses  is there a god beside me  yea   there is  no god  i know not  any   
9 	they that make a graven image  are  all of them vanity  and their delectable things shall not profit  and they  are  their own witnesses  they see not  nor know  that they may be ashamed  
10	who hath formed a god  or molten a graven image  that  is profitable for nothing  
11	behold  all his fellows shall be ashamed  and the workmen  they  are  of men  let them all be gathered together  let them stand up   yet  they shall fear   and  they shall be ashamed together  
12	the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals  and fashioneth it with hammers  and worketh it with the strength of his arms  yea  he is hungry  and his strength faileth  he drinketh no water  and is faint  
13	the carpenter stretcheth out  his  rule  he marketh it out with a line  he fitteth it with planes  and he marketh it out with the compass  and maketh it after the figure of a man  according to the beauty of a man  that it may remain in the house  
14	he heweth him down cedars  and taketh the cypress and the oak  which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest  he planteth an ash  and the rain doth nourish  it   
15	then shall it be for a man to burn  for he will take thereof  and warm himself  yea  he kindleth  it   and baketh bread  yea  he maketh a god  and worshippeth  it   he maketh it a graven image  and falleth down thereto  
16	he burneth part thereof in the fire  with part thereof he eateth flesh  he roasteth roast  and is satisfied  yea  he warmeth  himself   and saith  aha  i am warm  i have seen the fire  
17	and the residue thereof he maketh a god   even  his graven image  he falleth down unto it  and worshippeth  it   and prayeth unto it  and saith  deliver me  for thou  art  my god  
18	they have not known nor understood  for he hath shut their eyes  that they cannot see   and  their hearts  that they cannot understand  
19	and none considereth in his heart  neither  is there  knowledge nor understanding to say  i have burned part of it in the fire  yea  also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof  i have roasted flesh  and eaten  it   and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination  shall i fall down to the stock of a tree  
20	he feedeth on ashes  a deceived heart hath turned him aside  that he cannot deliver his soul  nor say   is there  not a lie in my right hand  
21 	remember these  o jacob and israel  for thou  art  my servant  i have formed thee  thou  art  my servant  o israel  thou shalt not be forgotten of me  
22	i have blotted out  as a thick cloud  thy transgressions  and  as a cloud  thy sins  return unto me  for i have redeemed thee  
23	sing  o ye heavens  for the lord hath done  it   shout  ye lower parts of the earth  break forth into singing  ye mountains  o forest  and every tree therein  for the lord hath redeemed jacob  and glorified himself in israel  
24	thus saith the lord  thy redeemer  and he that formed thee from the womb  i  am  the lord that maketh all  things   that stretcheth forth the heavens alone  that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself  
25	that frustrateth the tokens of the liars  and maketh diviners mad  that turneth wise  men  backward  and maketh their knowledge foolish  
26	that confirmeth the word of his servant  and performeth the counsel of his messengers  that saith to jerusalem  thou shalt be inhabited  and to the cities of judah  ye shall be built  and i will raise up the decayed places thereof  
27	that saith to the deep  be dry  and i will dry up thy rivers

2	i will go before thee  and make the crooked places straight  i will break in pieces the gates of brass  and cut in sunder the bars of iron  
3	and i will give thee the treasures of darkness  and hidden riches of secret places  that thou mayest know that i  the lord  which call  thee  by thy name   am  the god of israel  
4	for jacob my servant s sake  and israel mine elect  i have even called thee by thy name  i have surnamed thee  though thou hast not known me

9	woe unto him that striveth with his maker   let  the potsherd  strive  with the potsherds of the earth  shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it  what makest thou  or thy work  he hath no hands  
10	woe unto him that saith unto  his  father  what begettest thou  or to the woman  what hast thou brought forth

12	i have made the earth  and created man upon it  i   even  my hands  have stretched out the heavens  and all their host have i commanded  
13	i have raised him up in righteousness  and i will direct all his ways  he shall build my city  and he shall let go my captives  not for price nor reward  saith the lord of hosts  
14	thus saith the lord  the labour of egypt  and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans  men of stature  shall come over unto thee  and they shall be thine  they shall come after thee  in chains they shall come over  and they shall fall down unto thee  they shall make supplication unto thee   saying   surely god  is  in thee  and  there is  none else   there is  no god

18	for thus saith the lord that created the heavens  god himself that formed the earth and made it  he hath established it  he created it not in vain  he formed it to be inhabited  i  am  the lord  and  there is  none else  
19	i have not spoken in secret  in a dark place of the earth  i said not unto the seed of jacob  seek ye me in vain  i the lord speak righteousness  i declare things that are right

1 	come down  and sit in the dust  o virgin daughter of babylon  sit on the ground   there is  no throne  o daughter of the chaldeans  for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate  
2	take the millstones  and grind meal  uncover thy locks  make bare the leg  uncover the thigh  pass over the rivers  
3	thy nakedness shall be uncovered  yea  thy shame shall be seen  i will take vengeance  and i will not meet  thee as  a man  
4	 as for  our redeemer  the lord of hosts  is  his name  the holy one of israel  
5	sit thou silent  and get thee into darkness  o daughter of the chaldeans  for thou shalt no more be called  the lady of kingdoms  
6	i was wroth with my people  i have polluted mine inheritance  and given them into thine hand  thou didst shew them no mercy  upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke  
7 	and thou saidst  i shall be a lady for ever   so  that thou didst not lay these  things  to thy heart  neither didst remember the latter end of it

9	but these two  things  shall come to thee in a moment in one day  the loss of children  and widowhood  they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries   and  for the great abundance of thine enchantments  
10	for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness  thou hast said  none seeth me  thy wisdom and thy knowledge  it hath perverted thee  and thou hast said in thine heart  i  am   and none else beside me  
11	therefore shall evil come upon thee  thou shalt not know from whence it riseth  and mischief shall fall upon thee  thou shalt not be able to put it off  and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly   which  thou shalt not know  
12	stand now with thine enchantments  and with the multitude of thy sorceries  wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth  if so be thou shalt be able to profit  if so be thou mayest prevail  
13	thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels  let now the astrologers  the stargazers  the monthly prognosticators  stand up  and save thee from  these things  that shall come upon thee

1 	hear ye this  o house of jacob  which are called by the name of israel  and are come forth out of the waters of judah  which swear by the name of the lord  and make mention of the god of israel   but  not in truth  nor in righteousness  
2	for they call themselves of the holy city  and stay themselves upon the god of israel  the lord of hosts  is  his name  
3	i have declared the former things from the beginning  and they went forth out of my mouth  and i shewed them  i did  them  suddenly  and they came to pass  
4	because i knew that thou  art  obstinate  and thy neck  is  an iron sinew  and thy brow brass  
5	i have even from the beginning declared  it  to thee  before it came to pass i shewed  it  thee  lest thou shouldest say  mine idol hath done them  and my graven image  and my molten image  hath commanded them  
6	thou hast heard  see all this  and will not ye declare  it   i have shewed thee new things from this time  even hidden things  and thou didst not know them  
7	they are created now  and not from the beginning  even before the day when thou heardest them not  lest thou shouldest say  behold  i knew them  
8	yea  thou heardest not  yea  thou knewest not  yea  from that time  that  thine ear was not opened  for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously  and wast called a transgressor from the womb  
9 	for my name s sake will i defer mine anger  and for my praise will i refrain for thee  that i cut thee not off  
10	behold  i have refined thee  but not with silver  i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction  
11	for mine own sake   even  for mine own sake  will i do  it   for how should  my name  be polluted  and i will not give my glory unto another  
12	hearken unto me  o jacob and israel  my called  i  am  he  i  am  the first  i also  am  the last  
13	mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth  and my right hand hath spanned the heavens   when  i call unto them  they stand up together  
14	all ye  assemble yourselves  and hear  which among them hath declared these  things   the lord hath loved him  he will do his pleasure on babylon  and his arm  shall be on  the chaldeans  
15	i   even  i  have spoken  yea  i have called him  i have brought him  and he shall make his way prosperous  
16 	come ye near unto me  hear ye this  i have not spoken in secret from the beginning  from the time that it was  there  am  i  and now the lord god  and his spirit  hath sent me

18	o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments  then had thy peace been as a river  and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea  
19	thy seed also had been as the sand  and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof  his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me  
20	go ye forth of babylon  flee ye from the chaldeans  with a voice of singing declare ye  tell this  utter it  even  to the end of the earth  say ye  the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob  
21	and they thirsted not  when  he led them through the deserts  he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them  he clave the rock also  and the waters gushed out  
22	 there is  no peace  saith the lord  unto the wicked

1 	listen  o isles  unto me  and hearken  ye people  from far  the lord hath called me from the womb  from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name  
2	and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword  in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me  and made me a polished shaft  in his quiver hath he hid me  
3	and said unto me  thou  art  my servant  o israel  in whom i will be glorified  
4	then i said  i have laboured in vain  i have spent my strength for nought  and in vain   yet  surely my judgment  is  with the lord  and my work with my god  
5	and now  saith the lord that formed me from the womb  to be  his servant  to bring jacob again to him  though israel be not gathered  yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord  and my god shall be my strength  
6	and he said  it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob  and to restore the preserved of israel  i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles  that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth  
7 	thus saith the lord  the redeemer of israel   and  his holy one  to him whom man despiseth  to him whom the nation abhorreth  to a servant of rulers  kings shall see and arise  princes also shall worship  because of the lord that is faithful   and  the holy one of israel  and he shall choose thee  
8	thus saith the lord  in an acceptable time have i heard thee  and in a day of salvation have i helped thee  and i will preserve thee  and give thee for a covenant of the people  to establish the earth  to cause to inherit the desolate heritages  
9	that thou mayest say to the prisoners  go forth  to them that  are  in darkness  shew yourselves  they shall feed in the ways  and their pastures  shall be  in all high places  
10	they shall not hunger nor thirst  neither shall the heat nor sun smite them  for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them  even by the springs of water shall he guide them  
11	and i will make all my mountains a way  and my highways shall be exalted  
12	behold  these shall come from far  and  lo  these from the north and from the west  and these from the land of sinim  
13 	sing  o heavens  and be joyful  o earth  and break forth into singing  o mountains  for the lord hath comforted his people  and will have mercy upon his afflicted  
14	but zion said  the lord hath forsaken me  and my lord hath forgotten me  
15	can a woman forget her sucking child  that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb  yea  they may forget  yet will i not forget thee  
16	behold  i have graven thee upon the palms of  my  hands  thy walls  are  continually before me  
17	thy children shall make haste  thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee  
18 	lift up thine eyes round about  and behold  all these gather themselves together   and  come to thee   as  i live  saith the lord  thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all  as with an ornament  and bind them  on thee   as a bride  doeth   
19	for thy waste and thy desolate places  and the land of thy destruction  shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants  and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away  
20	the children which thou shalt have  after thou hast lost the other  shall say again in thine ears  the place  is  too strait for me  give place to me that i may dwell  
21	then shalt thou say in thine heart  who hath begotten me these  seeing i have lost my children  and am desolate  a captive  and removing to and fro  and who hath brought up these  behold  i was left alone  these  where  had  they  been   
22	thus saith the lord god  behold  i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles  and set up my standard to the people  and they shall bring thy sons in  their  arms  and thy daughters shall be carried upon  their  shoulders  
23	and kings shall be thy nursing fathers  and their queens thy nursing mothers  they shall bow down to thee with  their  face toward the earth  and lick up the dust of thy feet  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me  
24 	shall the prey be taken from the mighty  or the lawful captive delivered  
25	but thus saith the lord  even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away  and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered  for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee  and i will save thy children  
26	and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh  and they shall be drunken with their own blood  as with sweet wine  and all flesh shall know that i the lord  am  thy saviour and thy redeemer  the mighty one of jacob

2	wherefore  when i came   was there  no man  when i called   was there  none to answer  is my hand shortened at all  that it cannot redeem  or have i no power to deliver  behold  at my rebuke i dry up the sea  i make the rivers a wilderness  their fish stinketh  because  there is  no water  and dieth for thirst

5	the lord god hath opened mine ear  and i was not rebellious  neither turned away back  
6	i gave my back to the smiters  and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair  i hid not my face from shame and spitting

3	he is despised and rejected of men  a man of sorrows  and acquainted with grief  and we hid as it were  our  faces from him  he was despised  and we esteemed him not  
4 	surely he hath borne our griefs  and carried our sorrows  yet we did esteem him stricken  smitten of god  and afflicted  
5	but he  was  wounded for our transgressions   he was  bruised for our iniquities  the chastisement of our peace  was  upon him  and with his stripes we are healed  
6	all we like sheep have gone astray  we have turned every one to his own way  and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all  
7	he was oppressed  and he was afflicted  yet he opened not his mouth  he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter  and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb  so he openeth not his mouth  
8	he was taken from prison and from judgment  and who shall declare his generation  for he was cut off out of the land of the living  for the transgression of my people was he stricken  
9	and he made his grave with the wicked  and with the rich in his death  because he had done no violence  neither  was any  deceit in his mouth

2	he shall enter into peace  they shall rest in their beds   each one  walking  in  his uprightness  
3 	but draw near hither  ye sons of the sorceress  the seed of the adulterer and the whore  
4	against whom do ye sport yourselves  against whom make ye a wide mouth   and  draw out the tongue   are  ye not children of transgression  a seed of falsehood  
5	enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree  slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks  
6	among the smooth  stones  of the stream  is  thy portion  they  they  are  thy lot  even to them hast thou poured a drink offering  thou hast offered a meat offering  should i receive comfort in these  
7	upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed  even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice  
8	behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance  for thou hast discovered  thyself to another  than me  and art gone up  thou hast enlarged thy bed  and made thee  a covenant  with them  thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest  it   
9	and thou wentest to the king with ointment  and didst increase thy perfumes  and didst send thy messengers far off  and didst debase  thyself even  unto hell  
10	thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way   yet  saidst thou not  there is no hope  thou hast found the life of thine hand  therefore thou wast not grieved  
11	and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared  that thou hast lied  and hast not remembered me  nor laid  it  to thy heart  have not i held my peace even of old  and thou fearest me not  
12	i will declare thy righteousness  and thy works  for they shall not profit thee  
13 	when thou criest  let thy companies deliver thee  but the wind shall carry them all away  vanity shall take  them   but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land  and shall inherit my holy mountain  
14	and shall say  cast ye up  cast ye up  prepare the way  take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people  
15	for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity  whose name  is  holy  i dwell in the high and holy  place   with him also  that is  of a contrite and humble spirit  to revive the spirit of the humble  and to revive the heart of the contrite ones  
16	for i will not contend for ever  neither will i be always wroth  for the spirit should fail before me  and the souls  which  i have made  
17 	for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth  and smote him  i hid me  and was wroth  and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart  
18	i have seen his ways  and will heal him  i will lead him also  and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners  
19	i create the fruit of the lips  peace  peace to  him that is  far off  and to  him that is  near  saith the lord  and i will heal him  
20	but the wicked  are  like the troubled sea  when it cannot rest  whose waters cast up mire and dirt  
21	 there is  no peace  saith my god  to the wicked  
isaiah 58
1 	cry aloud  spare not  lift up thy voice like a trumpet  and shew my people their transgression  and the house of jacob their sins  
2	yet they seek me daily  and delight to know my ways  as a nation that did righteousness  and forsook not the ordinance of their god  they ask of me the ordinances of justice  they take delight in approaching to god  
3 	wherefore have we fasted   say they   and thou seest not   wherefore  have we afflicted our soul  and thou takest no knowledge  behold  in the day of your fast ye find pleasure  and exact all your labours  
4	behold  ye fast for strife and debate  and to smite with the fist of wickedness  ye shall not fast as  ye do this  day  to make your voice to be heard on high  
5	is it such a fast that i have chosen  a day for a man to afflict his soul   is it  to bow down his head as a bulrush  and to spread sackcloth and ashes  under him   wilt thou call this a fast  and an acceptable day to the lord  
6	 is  not this the fast that i have chosen  to loose the bands of wickedness  to undo the heavy burdens  and to let the oppressed go free  and that ye break every yoke  
7	 is it  not to deal thy bread to the hungry  and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house  when thou seest the naked  that thou cover him  and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh  
8 	then shall thy light break forth as the morning  and thine health shall spring forth speedily  and thy righteousness shall go before thee  the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward  
9	then shalt thou call  and the lord shall answer  thou shalt cry  and he shall say  here i  am   if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke  the putting forth of the finger  and speaking vanity  
10	and  if  thou draw out thy soul to the hungry  and satisfy the afflicted soul  then shall thy light rise in obscurity  and thy darkness  be  as the noonday  
11	and the lord shall guide thee continually  and satisfy thy soul in drought  and make fat thy bones  and thou shalt be like a watered garden  and like a spring of water  whose waters fail not  
12	and  they that shall be  of thee shall build the old waste places  thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations  and thou shalt be called  the repairer of the breach  the restorer of paths to dwell in  
13 	if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath   from  doing thy pleasure on my holy day  and call the sabbath a delight  the holy of the lord  honourable  and shalt honour him  not doing thine own ways  nor finding thine own pleasure  nor speaking  thine own  words  
14	then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord  and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth  and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father  for the mouth of the lord hath spoken  it   
isaiah 59
1 	behold  the lord s hand is not shortened  that it cannot save  neither his ear heavy  that it cannot hear  
2	but your iniquities have separated between you and your god  and your sins have hid  his  face from you  that he will not hear  
3	for your hands are defiled with blood  and your fingers with iniquity  your lips have spoken lies  your tongue hath muttered perverseness  
4	none calleth for justice  nor  any  pleadeth for truth  they trust in vanity  and speak lies  they conceive mischief  and bring forth iniquity  
5	they hatch cockatrice  eggs  and weave the spider s web  he that eateth of their eggs dieth  and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper  
6	their webs shall not become garments  neither shall they cover themselves with their works  their works  are  works of iniquity  and the act of violence  is  in their hands  
7	their feet run to evil  and they make haste to shed innocent blood  their thoughts  are  thoughts of iniquity  wasting and destruction  are  in their paths  
8	the way of peace they know not  and  there is  no judgment in their goings  they have made them crooked paths  whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace  
9 	therefore is judgment far from us  neither doth justice overtake us  we wait for light  but behold obscurity  for brightness   but  we walk in darkness  
10	we grope for the wall like the blind  and we grope as if  we had  no eyes  we stumble at noonday as in the night   we are  in desolate places as dead  men   
11	we roar all like bears  and mourn sore like doves  we look for judgment  but  there is  none  for salvation   but  it is far off from us  
12	for our transgressions are multiplied before thee  and our sins testify against us  for our transgressions  are  with us  and  as for  our iniquities  we know them  
13	in transgressing and lying against the lord  and departing away from our god  speaking oppression and revolt  conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood  
14	and judgment is turned away backward  and justice standeth afar off  for truth is fallen in the street  and equity cannot enter  
15	yea  truth faileth  and he  that  departeth from evil maketh himself a prey  and the lord saw  it   and it displeased him that  there was  no judgment  
16 	and he saw that  there was  no man  and wondered that  there was  no intercessor  therefore his arm brought salvation unto him  and his righteousness  it sustained him  
17	for he put on righteousness as a breastplate  and an helmet of salvation upon his head  and he put on the garments of vengeance  for  clothing  and was clad with zeal as a cloke  
18	according to  their  deeds  accordingly he will repay  fury to his adversaries  recompence to his enemies  to the islands he will repay recompence  
19	so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west  and his glory from the rising of the sun  when the enemy shall come in like a flood  the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him  
20	and the redeemer shall come to zion  and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob  saith the lord  
21	as for me  this  is  my covenant with them  saith the lord  my spirit that  is  upon thee  and my words which i have put in thy mouth  shall not depart out of thy mouth  nor out of the mouth of thy seed  nor out of the mouth of thy seed s seed  saith the lord  from henceforth and for ever  
isaiah 60
1 	arise  shine  for thy light is come  and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee  
2	for  behold  the darkness shall cover the earth  and gross darkness the people  but the lord shall arise upon thee  and his glory shall be seen upon thee  
3	and the gentiles shall come to thy light  and kings to the brightness of thy rising  
4	lift up thine eyes round about  and see  all they gather themselves together  they come to thee  thy sons shall come from far  and thy daughters shall be nursed at  thy  side  
5	then thou shalt see  and flow together  and thine heart shall fear  and be enlarged  because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee  the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee  
6	the multitude of camels shall cover thee  the dromedaries of midian and ephah  all they from sheba shall come  they shall bring gold and incense  and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord  
7	all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee  the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee  they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar  and i will glorify the house of my glory  
8	who  are  these  that  fly as a cloud  and as the doves to their windows  
9 	surely the isles shall wait for me  and the ships of tarshish first  to bring thy sons from far  their silver and their gold with them  unto the name of the lord thy god  and to the holy one of israel  because he hath glorified thee  
10	and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls  and their kings shall minister unto thee  for in my wrath i smote thee  but in my favour have i had mercy on thee  
11	therefore thy gates shall be open continually  they shall not be shut day nor night  that  men  may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles  and  that  their kings  may be  brought  
12	for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish  yea   those  nations shall be utterly wasted  
13	the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee  the fir tree  the pine tree  and the box together  to beautify the place of my sanctuary  and i will make the place of my feet glorious  
14	the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee  and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet  and they shall call thee  the city of the lord  the zion of the holy one of israel  
15 	whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated  so that no man went through  thee   i will make thee an eternal excellency  a joy of many generations  
16	thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles  and shalt suck the breast of kings  and thou shalt know that i the lord  am  thy saviour and thy redeemer  the mighty one of jacob  
17	for brass i will bring gold  and for iron i will bring silver  and for wood brass  and for stones iron  i will also make thy officers peace  and thine exactors righteousness  
18	violence shall no more be heard in thy land  wasting nor destruction within thy borders  but thou shalt call thy walls salvation  and thy gates praise  
19	the sun shall be no more thy light by day  neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee  but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light  and thy god thy glory  
20	thy sun shall no more go down  neither shall thy moon withdraw itself  for the lord shall be thine everlasting light  and the days of thy mourning shall be ended  
21	thy people also  shall be  all righteous  they shall inherit the land for ever  the branch of my planting  the work of my hands  that i may be glorified  
22	a little one shall become a thousand  and a small one a strong nation  i the lord will hasten it in his time  
isaiah 61
1 	the spirit of the lord god  is  upon me  because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted  to proclaim liberty to the captives  and the opening of the prison to  them that are  bound  
2	to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord  and the day of vengeance of our god  to comfort all that mourn  
3	to appoint unto them that mourn in zion  to give unto them beauty for ashes  the oil of joy for mourning  the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness  that they might be called trees of righteousness  the planting of the lord  that he might be glorified  
4 	and they shall build the old wastes  they shall raise up the former desolations  and they shall repair the waste cities  the desolations of many generations  
5	and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks  and the sons of the alien  shall be  your plowmen and your vinedressers  
6	but ye shall be named the priests of the lord   men  shall call you the ministers of our god  ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles  and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves  
7	for your shame  ye shall have  double  and  for  confusion they shall rejoice in their portion  therefore in their land they shall possess the double  everlasting joy shall be unto them  
8	for i the lord love judgment  i hate robbery for burnt offering  and i will direct their work in truth  and i will make an everlasting covenant with them  
9	and their seed shall be known among the gentiles  and their offspring among the people  all that see them shall acknowledge them  that they  are  the seed  which  the lord hath blessed  
10 	i will greatly rejoice in the lord  my soul shall be joyful in my god  for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation  he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness  as a bridegroom decketh  himself  with ornaments  and as a bride adorneth  herself  with her jewels  
11	for as the earth bringeth forth her bud  and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth  so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations  
isaiah 62
1 	for zion s sake will i not hold my peace  and for jerusalem s sake i will not rest  until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness  and the salvation thereof as a lamp  that  burneth  
2	and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness  and all kings thy glory  and thou shalt be called by a new name  which the mouth of the lord shall name  
3	thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord  and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god  
4	thou shalt no more be termed forsaken  neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate  but thou shalt be called hephzibah  and thy land beulah  for the lord delighteth in thee  and thy land shall be married  
5	for  as  a young man marrieth a virgin   so  shall thy sons marry thee  and  as  the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride   so  shall thy god rejoice over thee  
6 	i have set watchmen upon thy walls  o jerusalem   which  shall never hold their peace day nor night  ye that make mention of the lord  keep not silence  
7	and give him no rest  till he establish  and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth  
8	the lord hath sworn by his right hand  and by the arm of his strength  surely i will no more give thy corn  to be  meat for thine enemies  and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine  for the which thou hast laboured  
9	but they that have gathered it shall eat it  and praise the lord  and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness  
10 	go through  go through the gates  prepare ye the way of the people  cast up  cast up the highway  gather out the stones  lift up a standard for the people  
11	behold  the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world  say ye to the daughter of zion  behold  thy salvation cometh  behold  his reward  is  with him  and his work before him  
12	and they shall call them  the holy people  the redeemed of the lord  and thou shalt be called  sought out  a city not forsaken  
isaiah 63
1 	who  is  this that cometh from edom  with dyed garments from bozrah  this  that is  glorious in his apparel  travelling in the greatness of his strength  i that speak in righteousness  mighty to save  
2	wherefore  art thou  red in thine apparel  and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat  
3	i have trodden the winepress alone  and of the people  there was  none with me  for i will tread them in mine anger  and trample them in my fury  and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments  and i will stain all my raiment  
4	for the day of vengeance  is  in mine heart  and the year of my redeemed is come  
5	and i looked  and  there was  none to help  and i wondered that  there was  none to uphold  therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me  and my fury  it upheld me  
6	and i will tread down the people in mine anger  and make them drunk in my fury  and i will bring down their strength to the earth  
7 	i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord   and  the praises of the lord  according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us  and the great goodness toward the house of israel  which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies  and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses  
8	for he said  surely they  are  my people  children  that  will not lie  so he was their saviour  
9	in all their affliction he was afflicted  and the angel of his presence saved them  in his love and in his pity he redeemed them  and he bare them  and carried them all the days of old  
10	but they rebelled  and vexed his holy spirit  therefore he was turned to be their enemy   and  he fought against them  
11	then he remembered the days of old  moses   and  his people   saying   where  is  he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock  where  is  he that put his holy spirit within him  
12	that led  them  by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm  dividing the water before them  to make himself an everlasting name  
13	that led them through the deep  as an horse in the wilderness   that  they should not stumble  
14	as a beast goeth down into the valley  the spirit of the lord caused him to rest  so didst thou lead thy people  to make thyself a glorious name  
15 	look down from heaven  and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory  where  is  thy zeal and thy strength  the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me  are they restrained  
16	doubtless thou  art  our father  though abraham be ignorant of us  and israel acknowledge us not  thou  o lord   art  our father  our redeemer  thy name  is  from everlasting  
17	o lord  why hast thou made us to err from thy ways   and  hardened our heart from thy fear  return for thy servants  sake  the tribes of thine inheritance  
18	the people of thy holiness have possessed  it  but a little while  our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary  
19	we are  thine   thou never barest rule over them  they were not called by thy name  
isaiah 64
1 	oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens  that thou wouldest come down  that the mountains might flow down at thy presence  
2	as  when  the melting fire burneth  the fire causeth the waters to boil  to make thy name known to thine adversaries   that  the nations may tremble at thy presence  
3	when thou didst terrible things  which  we looked not for  thou camest down  the mountains flowed down at thy presence  
4	for since the beginning of the world  men  have not heard  nor perceived by the ear  neither hath the eye seen  o god  beside thee   what  he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him  
5	thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness   those that  remember thee in thy ways  behold  thou art wroth  for we have sinned  in those is continuance  and we shall be saved  
6 	but we are all as an unclean  thing   and all our righteousnesses  are  as filthy rags  and we all do fade as a leaf  and our iniquities  like the wind  have taken us away  
7	and  there is  none that calleth upon thy name  that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee  for thou hast hid thy face from us  and hast consumed us  because of our iniquities  
8	but now  o lord  thou  art  our father  we  are  the clay  and thou our potter  and we all  are  the work of thy hand  
9	be not wroth very sore  o lord  neither remember iniquity for ever  behold  see  we beseech thee  we  are  all thy people  
10	thy holy cities are a wilderness  zion is a wilderness  jerusalem a desolation  
11	our holy and our beautiful house  where our fathers praised thee  is burned up with fire  and all our pleasant things are laid waste  
12	wilt thou refrain thyself for these  things   o lord  wilt thou hold thy peace  and afflict us very sore  
isaiah 65
1 	i am sought of  them that  asked not  for me   i am found of  them that  sought me not  i said  behold me  behold me  unto a nation  that  was not called by my name  
2	i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people  which walketh in a way  that was  not good  after their own thoughts  
3	a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face  that sacrificeth in gardens  and burneth incense upon altars of brick  
4	which remain among the graves  and lodge in the monuments  which eat swine s flesh  and broth of abominable  things is in  their vessels  
5	which say  stand by thyself  come not near to me  for i am holier than thou  these  are  a smoke in my nose  a fire that burneth all the day  
6	behold   it is  written before me  i will not keep silence  but will recompense  even recompense into their bosom  
7	your iniquities  and the iniquities of your fathers together  saith the lord  which have burned incense upon the mountains  and blasphemed me upon the hills  therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom  
8 	thus saith the lord  as the new wine is found in the cluster  and  one  saith  destroy it not  for a blessing  is  in it  so will i do for my servants  sakes  that i may not destroy them all  
9	and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob  and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains  and mine elect shall inherit it  and my servants shall dwell there  
10	and sharon shall be a fold of flocks  and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in  for my people that have sought me  
11 	but ye  are  they that forsake the lord  that forget my holy mountain  that prepare a table for that troop  and that furnish the drink offering unto that number  
12	therefore will i number you to the sword  and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter  because when i called  ye did not answer  when i spake  ye did not hear  but did evil before mine eyes  and did choose  that  wherein i delighted not  
13	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  my servants shall eat  but ye shall be hungry  behold  my servants shall drink  but ye shall be thirsty  behold  my servants shall rejoice  but ye shall be ashamed  
14	behold  my servants shall sing for joy of heart  but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart  and shall howl for vexation of spirit  
15	and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen  for the lord god shall slay thee  and call his servants by another name  
16	that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth  and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth  because the former troubles are forgotten  and because they are hid from mine eyes  
17 	for  behold  i create new heavens and a new earth  and the former shall not be remembered  nor come into mind  
18	but be ye glad and rejoice for ever  in that  which i create  for  behold  i create jerusalem a rejoicing  and her people a joy  
19	and i will rejoice in jerusalem  and joy in my people  and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her  nor the voice of crying  
20	there shall be no more thence an infant of days  nor an old man that hath not filled his days  for the child shall die an hundred years old  but the sinner  being  an hundred years old shall be accursed  
21	and they shall build houses  and inhabit  them   and they shall plant vineyards  and eat the fruit of them  
22	they shall not build  and another inhabit  they shall not plant  and another eat  for as the days of a tree  are  the days of my people  and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands  
23	they shall not labour in vain  nor bring forth for trouble  for they  are  the seed of the blessed of the lord  and their offspring with them  
24	and it shall come to pass  that before they call  i will answer  and while they are yet speaking  i will hear  
25	the wolf and the lamb shall feed together  and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock  and dust  shall be  the serpent s meat  they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain  saith the lord  
isaiah 66
1 	thus saith the lord  the heaven  is  my throne  and the earth  is  my footstool  where  is  the house that ye build unto me  and where  is  the place of my rest  
2	for all those  things  hath mine hand made  and all those  things  have been  saith the lord  but to this  man  will i look   even  to  him that is  poor and of a contrite spirit  and trembleth at my word  
3	he that killeth an ox  is as if  he slew a man  he that sacrificeth a lamb   as if  he cut off a dog s neck  he that offereth an oblation   as if he offered  swine s blood  he that burneth incense   as if  he blessed an idol  yea  they have chosen their own ways  and their soul delighteth in their abominations  
4	i also will choose their delusions  and will bring their fears upon them  because when i called  none did answer  when i spake  they did not hear  but they did evil before mine eyes  and chose  that  in which i delighted not  
5 	hear the word of the lord  ye that tremble at his word  your brethren that hated you  that cast you out for my name s sake  said  let the lord be glorified  but he shall appear to your joy  and they shall be ashamed  
6	a voice of noise from the city  a voice from the temple  a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies  
7	before she travailed  she brought forth  before her pain came  she was delivered of a man child  
8	who hath heard such a thing  who hath seen such things  shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day   or  shall a nation be born at once  for as soon as zion travailed  she brought forth her children  
9	shall i bring to the birth  and not cause to bring forth  saith the lord  shall i cause to bring forth  and shut  the womb   saith thy god  
10	rejoice ye with jerusalem  and be glad with her  all ye that love her  rejoice for joy with her  all ye that mourn for her  
11	that ye may suck  and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations  that ye may milk out  and be delighted with the abundance of her glory  
12	for thus saith the lord  behold  i will extend peace to her like a river  and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream  then shall ye suck  ye shall be borne upon  her  sides  and be dandled upon  her  knees  
13	as one whom his mother comforteth  so will i comfort you  and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem  
14	and when ye see  this   your heart shall rejoice  and your bones shall flourish like an herb  and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants  and  his  indignation toward his enemies  
15 	for  behold  the lord will come with fire  and with his chariots like a whirlwind  to render his anger with fury  and his rebuke with flames of fire  
16	for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh  and the slain of the lord shall be many  
17	they that sanctify themselves  and purify themselves in the gardens behind one  tree  in the midst  eating swine s flesh  and the abomination  and the mouse  shall be consumed together  saith the lord  
18	for i  know  their works and their thoughts  it shall come  that i will gather all nations and tongues  and they shall come  and see my glory  
19	and i will set a sign among them  and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations   to  tarshish  pul  and lud  that draw the bow   to  tubal  and javan   to  the isles afar off  that have not heard my fame  neither have seen my glory  and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles  
20	and they shall bring all your brethren  for  an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses  and in chariots  and in litters  and upon mules  and upon swift beasts  to my holy mountain jerusalem  saith the lord  as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord  
21	and i will also take of them for priests  and  for levites  saith the lord  
22	for as the new heavens and the new earth  which i will make  shall remain before me  saith the lord  so shall your seed and your name remain  
23	and it shall come to pass   that  from one new moon to another  and from one sabbath to another  shall all flesh come to worship before me  saith the lord  
24	and they shall go forth  and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me  for their worm shall not die  neither shall their fire be quenched  and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh  

jeremiah
jeremiah 1
1 	the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah  of the priests that  were  in anathoth in the land of benjamin  
2	to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah  in the thirteenth year of his reign  
3	it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah  unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month  
4 	then the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
5	before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee  and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee   and  i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations  
6	then said i  ah  lord god  behold  i cannot speak  for i  am  a child  
7	but the lord said unto me  say not  i  am  a child  for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee  and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak  
8	be not afraid of their faces  for i  am  with thee to deliver thee  saith the lord  
9	then the lord put forth his hand  and touched my mouth  and the lord said unto me  behold  i have put my words in thy mouth  
10	see  i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms  to root out  and to pull down  and to destroy  and to throw down  to build  and to plant  
11 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  jeremiah  what seest thou  and i said  i see a rod of an almond tree  
12	then said the lord unto me  thou hast well seen  for i will hasten my word to perform it  
13	and the word of the lord came unto me the second time  saying  what seest thou  and i said  i see a seething pot  and the face thereof  is  toward the north  
14	then the lord said unto me  out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land  
15	for  lo  i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north  saith the lord  and they shall come  and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem  and against all the walls thereof round about  and against all the cities of judah  
16	and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness  who have forsaken me  and have burned incense unto other gods  and worshipped the works of their own hands  
17	thou therefore gird up thy loins  and arise  and speak unto them all that i command thee  be not dismayed at their faces  lest i confound thee before them  
18	for  behold  i have made thee this day a defenced city  and an iron pillar  and brasen walls against the whole land  against the kings of judah  against the princes thereof  against the priests thereof  and against the people of the land  
19	and they shall fight against thee  but they shall not prevail against thee  for i  am  with thee  saith the lord  to deliver thee  
jeremiah 2
1 	moreover the word of the lord came to me  saying  
2	go and cry in the ears of jerusalem  saying  thus saith the lord  i remember thee  the kindness of thy youth  the love of thine espousals  when thou wentest after me in the wilderness  in a land  that was  not sown  
3	israel  was  holiness unto the lord   and  the firstfruits of his increase  all that devour him shall offend  evil shall come upon them  saith the lord  
4	hear ye the word of the lord  o house of jacob  and all the families of the house of israel  
5	thus saith the lord  what iniquity have your fathers found in me  that they are gone far from me  and have walked after vanity  and are become vain  
6	neither said they  where  is  the lord that brought us up out of the land of egypt  that led us through the wilderness  through a land of deserts and of pits  through a land of drought  and of the shadow of death  through a land that no man passed through  and where no man dwelt  
7	and i brought you into a plentiful country  to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof  but when ye entered  ye defiled my land  and made mine heritage an abomination  
8	the priests said not  where  is  the lord  and they that handle the law knew me not  the pastors also transgressed against me  and the prophets prophesied by baal  and walked after  things that  do not profit  
9 	wherefore i will yet plead with you  saith the lord  and with your children s children will i plead  
10	for pass over the isles of chittim  and see  and send unto kedar  and consider diligently  and see if there be such a thing  
11	hath a nation changed  their  gods  which  are  yet no gods  but my people have changed their glory for  that which  doth not profit  
12	be astonished  o ye heavens  at this  and be horribly afraid  be ye very desolate  saith the lord  
13	for my people have committed two evils  they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters   and  hewed them out cisterns  broken cisterns  that can hold no water  
14 	 is  israel a servant   is  he a homeborn  slave   why is he spoiled  
15	the young lions roared upon him   and  yelled  and they made his land waste  his cities are burned without inhabitant  
16	also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head  
17	hast thou not procured this unto thyself  in that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god  when he led thee by the way  
18	and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt  to drink the waters of sihor  or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria  to drink the waters of the river  
19	thine own wickedness shall correct thee  and thy backslidings shall reprove thee  know therefore and see that  it is  an evil  thing  and bitter  that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god  and that my fear  is  not in thee  saith the lord god of hosts  
20 	for of old time i have broken thy yoke   and  burst thy bands  and thou saidst  i will not transgress  when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest  playing the harlot  
21	yet i had planted thee a noble vine  wholly a right seed  how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me  
22	for though thou wash thee with nitre  and take thee much soap   yet  thine iniquity is marked before me  saith the lord god  
23	how canst thou say  i am not polluted  i have not gone after baalim  see thy way in the valley  know what thou hast done   thou art  a swift dromedary traversing her ways  
24	a wild ass used to the wilderness   that  snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure  in her occasion who can turn her away  all they that seek her will not weary themselves  in her month they shall find her  
25	withhold thy foot from being unshod  and thy throat from thirst  but thou saidst  there is no hope  no  for i have loved strangers  and after them will i go  
26	as the thief is ashamed when he is found  so is the house of israel ashamed  they  their kings  their princes  and their priests  and their prophets  
27	saying to a stock  thou  art  my father  and to a stone  thou hast brought me forth  for they have turned  their  back unto me  and not  their  face  but in the time of their trouble they will say  arise  and save us  
28	but where  are  thy gods that thou hast made thee  let them arise  if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble  for  according to  the number of thy cities are thy gods  o judah  
29 	wherefore will ye plead with me  ye all have transgressed against me  saith the lord  
30	in vain have i smitten your children  they received no correction  your own sword hath devoured your prophets  like a destroying lion  
31	o generation  see ye the word of the lord  have i been a wilderness unto israel  a land of darkness  wherefore say my people  we are lords  we will come no more unto thee  
32	can a maid forget her ornaments   or  a bride her attire  yet my people have forgotten me days without number  
33	why trimmest thou thy way to seek love  therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways  
34	also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents  i have not found it by secret search  but upon all these  
35	yet thou sayest  because i am innocent  surely his anger shall turn from me  behold  i will plead with thee  because thou sayest  i have not sinned  
36	why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way  thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt  as thou wast ashamed of assyria  
37	yea  thou shalt go forth from him  and thine hands upon thine head  for the lord hath rejected thy confidences  and thou shalt not prosper in them  
jeremiah 3
1 	they say  if a man put away his wife  and she go from him  and become another man s  shall he return unto her again  shall not that land be greatly polluted  but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers  yet return again to me  saith the lord  
2	lift up thine eyes unto the high places  and see where thou hast not been lien with  in the ways hast thou sat for them  as the arabian in the wilderness  and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness  
3	therefore the showers have been withholden  and there hath been no latter rain  and thou hadst a whore s forehead  thou refusedst to be ashamed  
4	wilt thou not from this time cry unto me  my father  thou  art  the guide of my youth  
5	will he reserve  his anger  for ever  will he keep  it  to the end  behold  thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest  
6 	the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king  hast thou seen  that  which backsliding israel hath done  she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree  and there hath played the harlot  
7	and i said after she had done all these  things   turn thou unto me  but she returned not  and her treacherous sister judah saw  it   
8	and i saw  when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away  and given her a bill of divorce  yet her treacherous sister judah feared not  but went and played the harlot also  
9	and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom  that she defiled the land  and committed adultery with stones and with stocks  
10	and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart  but feignedly  saith the lord  
11	and the lord said unto me  the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah  
12 	go and proclaim these words toward the north  and say  return  thou backsliding israel  saith the lord   and  i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you  for i  am  merciful  saith the lord   and  i will not keep  anger  for ever  
13	only acknowledge thine iniquity  that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god  and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree  and ye have not obeyed my voice  saith the lord  
14	turn  o backsliding children  saith the lord  for i am married unto you  and i will take you one of a city  and two of a family  and i will bring you to zion  
15	and i will give you pastors according to mine heart  which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding  
16	and it shall come to pass  when ye be multiplied and increased in the land  in those days  saith the lord  they shall say no more  the ark of the covenant of the lord  neither shall it come to mind  neither shall they remember it  neither shall they visit  it   neither shall  that  be done any more  
17	at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord  and all the nations shall be gathered unto it  to the name of the lord  to jerusalem  neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart  
18	in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel  and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers  
19	but i said  how shall i put thee among the children  and give thee a pleasant land  a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations  and i said  thou shalt call me  my father  and shalt not turn away from me  
20 	surely  as  a wife treacherously departeth from her husband  so have ye dealt treacherously with me  o house of israel  saith the lord  
21	a voice was heard upon the high places  weeping  and  supplications of the children of israel  for they have perverted their way   and  they have forgotten the lord their god  
22	return  ye backsliding children   and  i will heal your backslidings  behold  we come unto thee  for thou  art  the lord our god  
23	truly in vain  is salvation hoped for  from the hills   and from  the multitude of mountains  truly in the lord our god  is  the salvation of israel  
24	for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth  their flocks and their herds  their sons and their daughters  
25	we lie down in our shame  and our confusion covereth us  for we have sinned against the lord our god  we and our fathers  from our youth even unto this day  and have not obeyed the voice of the lord our god  
jeremiah 4
1 	if thou wilt return  o israel  saith the lord  return unto me  and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight  then shalt thou not remove  
2	and thou shalt swear  the lord liveth  in truth  in judgment  and in righteousness  and the nations shall bless themselves in him  and in him shall they glory  
3 	for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem  break up your fallow ground  and sow not among thorns  
4	circumcise yourselves to the lord  and take away the foreskins of your heart  ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem  lest my fury come forth like fire  and burn that none can quench  it   because of the evil of your doings  
5 	declare ye in judah  and publish in jerusalem  and say  blow ye the trumpet in the land  cry  gather together  and say  assemble yourselves  and let us go into the defenced cities  
6	set up the standard toward zion  retire  stay not  for i will bring evil from the north  and a great destruction  
7	the lion is come up from his thicket  and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way  he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate   and  thy cities shall be laid waste  without an inhabitant  
8	for this gird you with sackcloth  lament and howl  for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us  
9	and it shall come to pass at that day  saith the lord   that  the heart of the king shall perish  and the heart of the princes  and the priests shall be astonished  and the prophets shall wonder  
10	then said i  ah  lord god  surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem  saying  ye shall have peace  whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul  
11	at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem  a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people  not to fan  nor to cleanse  
12	 even  a full wind from those  places  shall come unto me  now also will i give sentence against them  
13	behold  he shall come up as clouds  and his chariots  shall be  as a whirlwind  his horses are swifter than eagles  woe unto us  for we are spoiled  
14	o jerusalem  wash thine heart from wickedness  that thou mayest be saved  how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee  
15	for a voice declareth from dan  and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim  
16	make ye mention to the nations  behold  publish against jerusalem   that  watchers come from a far country  and give out their voice against the cities of judah  
17	as keepers of a field  are they against her round about  because she hath been rebellious against me  saith the lord  
18	thy way and thy doings have procured these  things  unto thee  this  is  thy wickedness  because it is bitter  because it reacheth unto thine heart  
19 	my bowels  my bowels  i am pained at my very heart  my heart maketh a noise in me  i cannot hold my peace  because thou hast heard  o my soul  the sound of the trumpet  the alarm of war  
20	destruction upon destruction is cried  for the whole land is spoiled  suddenly are my tents spoiled   and  my curtains in a moment  
21	how long shall i see the standard   and  hear the sound of the trumpet  
22	for my people  is  foolish  they have not known me  they  are  sottish children  and they have none understanding  they  are  wise to do evil  but to do good they have no knowledge  
23	i beheld the earth  and  lo   it was  without form  and void  and the heavens  and they  had  no light  
24	i beheld the mountains  and  lo  they trembled  and all the hills moved lightly  
25	i beheld  and  lo   there was  no man  and all the birds of the heavens were fled  
26	i beheld  and  lo  the fruitful place  was  a wilderness  and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord   and  by his fierce anger  
27	for thus hath the lord said  the whole land shall be desolate  yet will i not make a full end  
28	for this shall the earth mourn  and the heavens above be black  because i have spoken  it   i have purposed  it   and will not repent  neither will i turn back from it  
29	the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen  they shall go into thickets  and climb up upon the rocks  every city  shall be  forsaken  and not a man dwell therein  
30	and  when  thou  art  spoiled  what wilt thou do  though thou clothest thyself with crimson  though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold  though thou rentest thy face with painting  in vain shalt thou make thyself fair   thy  lovers will despise thee  they will seek thy life  
31	for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail   and  the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child  the voice of the daughter of zion   that  bewaileth herself   that  spreadeth her hands   saying   woe  is  me now  for my soul is wearied because of murderers  
jeremiah 5
1 	run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem  and see now  and know  and seek in the broad places thereof  if ye can find a man  if there be  any  that executeth judgment  that seeketh the truth  and i will pardon it  
2	and though they say  the lord liveth  surely they swear falsely  
3	o lord   are  not thine eyes upon the truth  thou hast stricken them  but they have not grieved  thou hast consumed them   but  they have refused to receive correction  they have made their faces harder than a rock  they have refused to return  
4	therefore i said  surely these  are  poor  they are foolish  for they know not the way of the lord   nor  the judgment of their god  
5	i will get me unto the great men  and will speak unto them  for they have known the way of the lord   and  the judgment of their god  but these have altogether broken the yoke   and  burst the bonds  
6	wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them   and  a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them  a leopard shall watch over their cities  every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces  because their transgressions are many   and  their backslidings are increased  
7	how shall i pardon thee for this  thy children have forsaken me  and sworn by  them that are  no gods  when i had fed them to the full  they then committed adultery  and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots  houses  
8	they were  as  fed horses in the morning  every one neighed after his neighbour s wife  
9	shall i not visit for these  things   saith the lord  and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  
10 	go ye up upon her walls  and destroy  but make not a full end  take away her battlements  for they  are  not the lord s  
11	for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me  saith the lord  
12	they have belied the lord  and said   it is  not he  neither shall evil come upon us  neither shall we see sword nor famine  
13	and the prophets shall become wind  and the word  is  not in them  thus shall it be done unto them  
14	wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts  because ye speak this word  behold  i will make my words in thy mouth fire  and this people wood  and it shall devour them  
15	lo  i will bring a nation upon you from far  o house of israel  saith the lord  it  is  a mighty nation  it  is  an ancient nation  a nation whose language thou knowest not  neither understandest what they say  
16	their quiver  is  as an open sepulchre  they  are  all mighty men  
17	and they shall eat up thine harvest  and thy bread   which  thy sons and thy daughters should eat  they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds  they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees  they shall impoverish thy fenced cities  wherein thou trustedst  with the sword  
18	nevertheless in those days  saith the lord  i will not make a full end with you  
19	and it shall come to pass  when ye shall say  wherefore doeth the lord our god all these  things  unto us  then shalt thou answer them  like as ye have forsaken me  and served strange gods in your land  so shall ye serve strangers in a land  that is  not yours  
20 	declare this in the house of jacob  and publish it in judah  saying  
21	hear now this  o foolish people  and without understanding  which have eyes  and see not  which have ears  and hear not  
22	fear ye not me  saith the lord  will ye not tremble at my presence  which have placed the sand  for  the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree  that it cannot pass it  and though the waves thereof toss themselves  yet can they not prevail  though they roar  yet can they not pass over it  
23	but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart  they are revolted and gone  
24	neither say they in their heart  let us now fear the lord our god  that giveth rain  both the former and the latter  in his season  he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest  
25 	your iniquities have turned away these  things   and your sins have withholden good  things  from you  
26	for among my people are found wicked  men   they lay wait  as he that setteth snares  they set a trap  they catch men  
27	as a cage is full of birds  so  are  their houses full of deceit  therefore they are become great  and waxen rich  
28	they are waxen fat  they shine  yea  they overpass the deeds of the wicked  they judge not the cause  the cause of the fatherless  yet they prosper  and the right of the needy do they not judge  
29	shall i not visit for these  things   saith the lord  shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  
30	a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land  
31	the prophets prophesy falsely  and the priests bear rule by their means  and my people love  to have it  so  and what will ye do in the end thereof  
jeremiah 6
1 	o ye children of benjamin  gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of jerusalem  and blow the trumpet in tekoa  and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem  for evil appeareth out of the north  and great destruction  
2	i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate  woman   
3	the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her  they shall pitch  their  tents against her round about  they shall feed every one in his place  
4	prepare ye war against her  arise  and let us go up at noon  woe unto us  for the day goeth away  for the shadows of the evening are stretched out  
5	arise  and let us go by night  and let us destroy her palaces  
6	for thus hath the lord of hosts said  hew ye down trees  and cast a mount against jerusalem  this  is  the city to be visited  she  is  wholly oppression in the midst of her  
7	as a fountain casteth out her waters  so she casteth out her wickedness  violence and spoil is heard in her  before me continually  is  grief and wounds  
8	be thou instructed  o jerusalem  lest my soul depart from thee  lest i make thee desolate  a land not inhabited  
9 	thus saith the lord of hosts  they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine  turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets  
10	to whom shall i speak  and give warning  that they may hear  behold  their ear  is  uncircumcised  and they cannot hearken  behold  the word of the lord is unto them a reproach  they have no delight in it  
11	therefore i am full of the fury of the lord  i am weary with holding in  i will pour it out upon the children abroad  and upon the assembly of young men together  for even the husband with the wife shall be taken  the aged with  him that is  full of days  
12	and their houses shall be turned unto others   with their  fields and wives together  for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land  saith the lord  
13	for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one  is  given to covetousness  and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely  
14	they have healed also the hurt  of the daughter  of my people slightly  saying  peace  peace  when  there is  no peace  
15	were they ashamed when they had committed abomination  nay  they were not at all ashamed  neither could they blush  therefore they shall fall among them that fall  at the time  that  i visit them they shall be cast down  saith the lord  
16	thus saith the lord  stand ye in the ways  and see  and ask for the old paths  where  is  the good way  and walk therein  and ye shall find rest for your souls  but they said  we will not walk  therein   
17	also i set watchmen over you   saying   hearken to the sound of the trumpet  but they said  we will not hearken  
18 	therefore hear  ye nations  and know  o congregation  what  is  among them  
19	hear  o earth  behold  i will bring evil upon this people   even  the fruit of their thoughts  because they have not hearkened unto my words  nor to my law  but rejected it  
20	to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba  and the sweet cane from a far country  your burnt offerings  are  not acceptable  nor your sacrifices sweet unto me  
21	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will lay stumblingblocks before this people  and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them  the neighbour and his friend shall perish  
22	thus saith the lord  behold  a people cometh from the north country  and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth  
23	they shall lay hold on bow and spear  they  are  cruel  and have no mercy  their voice roareth like the sea  and they ride upon horses  set in array as men for war against thee  o daughter of zion  
24	we have heard the fame thereof  our hands wax feeble  anguish hath taken hold of us   and  pain  as of a woman in travail  
25	go not forth into the field  nor walk by the way  for the sword of the enemy  and  fear  is  on every side  
26	o daughter of my people  gird  thee  with sackcloth  and wallow thyself in ashes  make thee mourning   as for  an only son  most bitter lamentation  for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us  
27	i have set thee  for  a tower  and  a fortress among my people  that thou mayest know and try their way  
28	they  are  all grievous revolters  walking with slanders   they are  brass and iron  they  are  all corrupters  
29	the bellows are burned  the lead is consumed of the fire  the founder melteth in vain  for the wicked are not plucked away  
30	reprobate silver shall  men  call them  because the lord hath rejected them  
jeremiah 7
1 	the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	stand in the gate of the lord s house  and proclaim there this word  and say  hear the word of the lord  all  ye of  judah  that enter in at these gates to worship the lord  
3	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  amend your ways and your doings  and i will cause you to dwell in this place  
4	trust ye not in lying words  saying  the temple of the lord  the temple of the lord  the temple of the lord   are  these  
5	for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings  if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour  
6	 if  ye oppress not the stranger  the fatherless  and the widow  and shed not innocent blood in this place  neither walk after other gods to your hurt  
7	then will i cause you to dwell in this place  in the land that i gave to your fathers  for ever and ever  
8	behold  ye trust in lying words  that cannot profit  
9	will ye steal  murder  and commit adultery  and swear falsely  and burn incense unto baal  and walk after other gods whom ye know not  
10	and come and stand before me in this house  which is called by my name  and say  we are delivered to do all these abominations  
11	is this house  which is called by my name  become a den of robbers in your eyes  behold  even i have seen  it   saith the lord  
12	but go ye now unto my place which  was  in shiloh  where i set my name at the first  and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel  
13	and now  because ye have done all these works  saith the lord  and i spake unto you  rising up early and speaking  but ye heard not  and i called you  but ye answered not  
14	therefore will i do unto  this  house  which is called by my name  wherein ye trust  and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers  as i have done to shiloh  
15	and i will cast you out of my sight  as i have cast out all your brethren   even  the whole seed of ephraim  
16 	therefore pray not thou for this people  neither lift up cry nor prayer for them  neither make intercession to me  for i will not hear thee  
17	seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem  
18	the children gather wood  and the fathers kindle the fire  and the women knead  their  dough  to make cakes to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods  that they may provoke me to anger  
19	do they provoke me to anger  saith the lord   do they  not  provoke  themselves to the confusion of their own faces  
20	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place  upon man  and upon beast  and upon the trees of the field  and upon the fruit of the ground  and it shall burn  and shall not be quenched  
21 	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices  and eat flesh  
22	for i spake not unto your fathers  nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt  concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices  
23	but this thing commanded i them  saying  obey my voice  and i will be your god  and ye shall be my people  and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you  that it may be well unto you  
24	but they hearkened not  nor inclined their ear  but walked in the counsels  and  in the imagination of their evil heart  and went backward  and not forward  
25	since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets  daily rising up early and sending  them   
26	yet they hearkened not unto me  nor inclined their ear  but hardened their neck  they did worse than their fathers  
27	therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them  but they will not hearken to thee  thou shalt also call unto them  but they will not answer thee  
28	but thou shalt say unto them  this  is  a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god  nor receiveth correction  truth is perished  and is cut off from their mouth  
29 	cut off thine hair   o jerusalem   and cast  it  away  and take up a lamentation on high places  for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath  
30	for the children of judah have done evil in my sight  saith the lord  they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name  to pollute it  
31	and they have built the high places of tophet  which  is  in the valley of the son of hinnom  to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire  which i commanded  them  not  neither came it into my heart  
32	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that it shall no more be called tophet  nor the valley of the son of hinnom  but the valley of slaughter  for they shall bury in tophet  till there be no place  
33	and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven  and for the beasts of the earth  and none shall fray  them  away  
34	then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah  and from the streets of jerusalem  the voice of mirth  and the voice of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom  and the voice of the bride  for the land shall be desolate  
jeremiah 8
1 	at that time  saith the lord  they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah  and the bones of his princes  and the bones of the priests  and the bones of the prophets  and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem  out of their graves  
2	and they shall spread them before the sun  and the moon  and all the host of heaven  whom they have loved  and whom they have served  and after whom they have walked  and whom they have sought  and whom they have worshipped  they shall not be gathered  nor be buried  they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth  
3	and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family  which remain in all the places whither i have driven them  saith the lord of hosts  
4 	moreover thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord  shall they fall  and not arise  shall he turn away  and not return  
5	why  then  is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding  they hold fast deceit  they refuse to return  
6	i hearkened and heard   but  they spake not aright  no man repented him of his wickedness  saying  what have i done  every one turned to his course  as the horse rusheth into the battle  
7	yea  the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times  and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming  but my people know not the judgment of the lord  
8	how do ye say  we  are  wise  and the law of the lord  is  with us  lo  certainly in vain made he  it   the pen of the scribes  is  in vain  
9	the wise  men  are ashamed  they are dismayed and taken  lo  they have rejected the word of the lord  and what wisdom  is  in them  
10	therefore will i give their wives unto others   and  their fields to them that shall inherit  them   for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness  from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely  
11	for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly  saying  peace  peace  when  there is  no peace  
12	were they ashamed when they had committed abomination  nay  they were not at all ashamed  neither could they blush  therefore shall they fall among them that fall  in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down  saith the lord  
13 	i will surely consume them  saith the lord   there shall be  no grapes on the vine  nor figs on the fig tree  and the leaf shall fade  and  the things that  i have given them shall pass away from them  
14	why do we sit still  assemble yourselves  and let us enter into the defenced cities  and let us be silent there  for the lord our god hath put us to silence  and given us water of gall to drink  because we have sinned against the lord  
15	we looked for peace  but no good  came  and  for a time of health  and behold trouble  
16	the snorting of his horses was heard from dan  the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones  for they are come  and have devoured the land  and all that is in it  the city  and those that dwell therein  
17	for  behold  i will send serpents  cockatrices  among you  which  will  not  be  charmed  and they shall bite you  saith the lord  
18	 when  i would comfort myself against sorrow  my heart  is  faint in me  
19	behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country   is  not the lord in zion   is  not her king in her  why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images   and  with strange vanities  
20	the harvest is past  the summer is ended  and we are not saved  
21	for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt  i am black  astonishment hath taken hold on me  
22	 is there  no balm in gilead   is there  no physician there  why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered  
jeremiah 9
1 	oh that my head were waters  and mine eyes a fountain of tears  that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people  
2	oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men  that i might leave my people  and go from them  for they  be  all adulterers  an assembly of treacherous men  
3	and they bend their tongues  like  their bow  for  lies  but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth  for they proceed from evil to evil  and they know not me  saith the lord  
4	take ye heed every one of his neighbour  and trust ye not in any brother  for every brother will utterly supplant  and every neighbour will walk with slanders  
5	and they will deceive every one his neighbour  and will not speak the truth  they have taught their tongue to speak lies   and  weary themselves to commit iniquity  
6	thine habitation  is  in the midst of deceit  through deceit they refuse to know me  saith the lord  
7	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  i will melt them  and try them  for how shall i do for the daughter of my people  
8	their tongue  is as  an arrow shot out  it speaketh deceit   one  speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth  but in heart he layeth his wait  
9	shall i not visit them for these  things   saith the lord  shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  
10	for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing  and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation  because they are burned up  so that none can pass through  them   neither can  men  hear the voice of the cattle  both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled  they are gone  
11	and i will make jerusalem heaps   and  a den of dragons  and i will make the cities of judah desolate  without an inhabitant  
12 	who  is  the wise man  that may understand this  and  who is he  to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken  that he may declare it  for what the land perisheth  and  is burned up like a wilderness  that none passeth through  
13	and the lord saith  because they have forsaken my law which i set before them  and have not obeyed my voice  neither walked therein  
14	but have walked after the imagination of their own heart  and after baalim  which their fathers taught them  
15	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will feed them   even  this people  with wormwood  and give them water of gall to drink  
16	i will scatter them also among the heathen  whom neither they nor their fathers have known  and i will send a sword after them  till i have consumed them  
17	thus saith the lord of hosts  consider ye  and call for the mourning women  that they may come  and send for cunning  women   that they may come  
18	and let them make haste  and take up a wailing for us  that our eyes may run down with tears  and our eyelids gush out with waters  
19	for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion  how are we spoiled  we are greatly confounded  because we have forsaken the land  because our dwellings have cast  us  out  
20	yet hear the word of the lord  o ye women  and let your ear receive the word of his mouth  and teach your daughters wailing  and every one her neighbour lamentation  
21	for death is come up into our windows   and  is entered into our palaces  to cut off the children from without   and  the young men from the streets  
22	speak  thus saith the lord  even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field  and as the handful after the harvestman  and none shall gather  them   
23 	thus saith the lord  let not the wise  man  glory in his wisdom  neither let the mighty  man  glory in his might  let not the rich  man  glory in his riches  
24	but let him that glorieth glory in this  that he understandeth and knoweth me  that i  am  the lord which exercise lovingkindness  judgment  and righteousness  in the earth  for in these  things  i delight  saith the lord  
25	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will punish all  them which are  circumcised with the uncircumcised  
26	egypt  and judah  and edom  and the children of ammon  and moab  and all  that are  in the utmost corners  that dwell in the wilderness  for all  these  nations  are  uncircumcised  and all the house of israel  are  uncircumcised in the heart  
jeremiah 10
1 	hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you  o house of israel  
2	thus saith the lord  learn not the way of the heathen  and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven  for the heathen are dismayed at them  
3	for the customs of the people  are  vain  for  one  cutteth a tree out of the forest  the work of the hands of the workman  with the axe  
4	they deck it with silver and with gold  they fasten it with nails and with hammers  that it move not  
5	they  are  upright as the palm tree  but speak not  they must needs be borne  because they cannot go  be not afraid of them  for they cannot do evil  neither also  is it  in them to do good  
6	forasmuch as  there is  none like unto thee  o lord  thou  art  great  and thy name  is  great in might  
7	who would not fear thee  o king of nations  for to thee doth it appertain  forasmuch as among all the wise  men  of the nations  and in all their kingdoms   there is  none like unto thee  
8	but they are altogether brutish and foolish  the stock  is  a doctrine of vanities  
9	silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish  and gold from uphaz  the work of the workman  and of the hands of the founder  blue and purple  is  their clothing  they  are  all the work of cunning  men   
10	but the lord  is  the true god  he  is  the living god  and an everlasting king  at his wrath the earth shall tremble  and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation  
11	thus shall ye say unto them  the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth   even  they shall perish from the earth  and from under these heavens  
12	he hath made the earth by his power  he hath established the world by his wisdom  and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion  
13	when he uttereth his voice   there is  a multitude of waters in the heavens  and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth  he maketh lightnings with rain  and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures  
14	every man is brutish in  his  knowledge  every founder is confounded by the graven image  for his molten image  is  falsehood  and  there is  no breath in them  
15	they  are  vanity   and  the work of errors  in the time of their visitation they shall perish  
16	the portion of jacob  is  not like them  for he  is  the former of all  things   and israel  is  the rod of his inheritance  the lord of hosts  is  his name  
17 	gather up thy wares out of the land  o inhabitant of the fortress  
18	for thus saith the lord  behold  i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once  and will distress them  that they may find  it so   
19	woe is me for my hurt  my wound is grievous  but i said  truly this  is  a grief  and i must bear it  
20	my tabernacle is spoiled  and all my cords are broken  my children are gone forth of me  and they  are  not   there is  none to stretch forth my tent any more  and to set up my curtains  
21	for the pastors are become brutish  and have not sought the lord  therefore they shall not prosper  and all their flocks shall be scattered  
22	behold  the noise of the bruit is come  and a great commotion out of the north country  to make the cities of judah desolate   and  a den of dragons  
23	o lord  i know that the way of man  is  not in himself   it is  not in man that walketh to direct his steps  
24	o lord  correct me  but with judgment  not in thine anger  lest thou bring me to nothing  
25	pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not  and upon the families that call not on thy name  for they have eaten up jacob  and devoured him  and consumed him  and have made his habitation desolate  
jeremiah 11
1 	the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	hear ye the words of this covenant  and speak unto the men of judah  and to the inhabitants of jerusalem  
3	and say thou unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  cursed  be  the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant  
4	which i commanded your fathers in the day  that  i brought them forth out of the land of egypt  from the iron furnace  saying  obey my voice  and do them  according to all which i command you  so shall ye be my people  and i will be your god  
5	that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers  to give them a land flowing with milk and honey  as  it is  this day  then answered i  and said  so be it  o lord  
6	then the lord said unto me  proclaim all these words in the cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  saying  hear ye the words of this covenant  and do them  
7	for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day  that  i brought them up out of the land of egypt   even  unto this day  rising early and protesting  saying  obey my voice  
8	yet they obeyed not  nor inclined their ear  but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart  therefore i will bring upon them all the words of this covenant  which i commanded  them  to do  but they did  them  not  
9	and the lord said unto me  a conspiracy is found among the men of judah  and among the inhabitants of jerusalem  
10	they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers  which refused to hear my words  and they went after other gods to serve them  the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers  
11 	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring evil upon them  which they shall not be able to escape  and though they shall cry unto me  i will not hearken unto them  
12	then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go  and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense  but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble  
13	for  according to  the number of thy cities were thy gods  o judah  and  according to  the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to  that  shameful thing   even  altars to burn incense unto baal  
14	therefore pray not thou for this people  neither lift up a cry or prayer for them  for i will not hear  them  in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble  
15	what hath my beloved to do in mine house   seeing  she hath wrought lewdness with many  and the holy flesh is passed from thee  when thou doest evil  then thou rejoicest  
16	the lord called thy name  a green olive tree  fair   and  of goodly fruit  with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it  and the branches of it are broken  
17	for the lord of hosts  that planted thee  hath pronounced evil against thee  for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah  which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal  
18 	and the lord hath given me knowledge  of it   and i know  it   then thou shewedst me their doings  
19	but i  was  like a lamb  or  an ox  that  is brought to the slaughter  and i knew not that they had devised devices against me   saying   let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof  and let us cut him off from the land of the living  that his name may be no more remembered  
20	but  o lord of hosts  that judgest righteously  that triest the reins and the heart  let me see thy vengeance on them  for unto thee have i revealed my cause  
21	therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth  that seek thy life  saying  prophesy not in the name of the lord  that thou die not by our hand  
22	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  i will punish them  the young men shall die by the sword  their sons and their daughters shall die by famine  
23	and there shall be no remnant of them  for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth   even  the year of their visitation  
jeremiah 12
1 	righteous  art  thou  o lord  when i plead with thee  yet let me talk with thee of  thy  judgments  wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper   wherefore  are all they happy that deal very treacherously  
2	thou hast planted them  yea  they have taken root  they grow  yea  they bring forth fruit  thou  art  near in their mouth  and far from their reins  
3	but thou  o lord  knowest me  thou hast seen me  and tried mine heart toward thee  pull them out like sheep for the slaughter  and prepare them for the day of slaughter  
4	how long shall the land mourn  and the herbs of every field wither  for the wickedness of them that dwell therein  the beasts are consumed  and the birds  because they said  he shall not see our last end  
5	if thou hast run with the footmen  and they have wearied thee  then how canst thou contend with horses  and  if  in the land of peace   wherein  thou trustedst   they wearied thee   then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan  
6	for even thy brethren  and the house of thy father  even they have dealt treacherously with thee  yea  they have called a multitude after thee  believe them not  though they speak fair words unto thee  
7 	i have forsaken mine house  i have left mine heritage  i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies  
8	mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest  it crieth out against me  therefore have i hated it  
9	mine heritage  is  unto me  as  a speckled bird  the birds round about  are  against her  come ye  assemble all the beasts of the field  come to devour  
10	many pastors have destroyed my vineyard  they have trodden my portion under foot  they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness  
11	they have made it desolate   and being  desolate it mourneth unto me  the whole land is made desolate  because no man layeth  it  to heart  
12	the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness  for the sword of the lord shall devour from the  one  end of the land even to the  other  end of the land  no flesh shall have peace  
13	they have sown wheat  but shall reap thorns  they have put themselves to pain   but  shall not profit  and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord  
14 	thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours  that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit  behold  i will pluck them out of their land  and pluck out the house of judah from among them  
15	and it shall come to pass  after that i have plucked them out i will return  and have compassion on them  and will bring them again  every man to his heritage  and every man to his land  
16	and it shall come to pass  if they will diligently learn the ways of my people  to swear by my name  the lord liveth  as they taught my people to swear by baal  then shall they be built in the midst of my people  
17	but if they will not obey  i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation  saith the lord  
jeremiah 13
1 	thus saith the lord unto me  go and get thee a linen girdle  and put it upon thy loins  and put it not in water  
2	so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord  and put  it  on my loins  
3	and the word of the lord came unto me the second time  saying  
4	take the girdle that thou hast got  which  is  upon thy loins  and arise  go to euphrates  and hide it there in a hole of the rock  
5	so i went  and hid it by euphrates  as the lord commanded me  
6	and it came to pass after many days  that the lord said unto me  arise  go to euphrates  and take the girdle from thence  which i commanded thee to hide there  
7	then i went to euphrates  and digged  and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it  and  behold  the girdle was marred  it was profitable for nothing  
8	then the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
9	thus saith the lord  after this manner will i mar the pride of judah  and the great pride of jerusalem  
10	this evil people  which refuse to hear my words  which walk in the imagination of their heart  and walk after other gods  to serve them  and to worship them  shall even be as this girdle  which is good for nothing  
11	for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man  so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah  saith the lord  that they might be unto me for a people  and for a name  and for a praise  and for a glory  but they would not hear  
12 	therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word  thus saith the lord god of israel  every bottle shall be filled with wine  and they shall say unto thee  do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine  
13	then shalt thou say unto them  thus saith the lord  behold  i will fill all the inhabitants of this land  even the kings that sit upon david s throne  and the priests  and the prophets  and all the inhabitants of jerusalem  with drunkenness  
14	and i will dash them one against another  even the fathers and the sons together  saith the lord  i will not pity  nor spare  nor have mercy  but destroy them  
15	hear ye  and give ear  be not proud  for the lord hath spoken  
16	give glory to the lord your god  before he cause darkness  and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains  and  while ye look for light  he turn it into the shadow of death   and  make  it  gross darkness  
17	but if ye will not hear it  my soul shall weep in secret places for  your  pride  and mine eye shall weep sore  and run down with tears  because the lord s flock is carried away captive  
18	say unto the king and to the queen  humble yourselves  sit down  for your principalities shall come down   even  the crown of your glory  
19	the cities of the south shall be shut up  and none shall open  them   judah shall be carried away captive all of it  it shall be wholly carried away captive  
20	lift up your eyes  and behold them that come from the north  where  is  the flock  that  was given thee  thy beautiful flock  
21	what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee  for thou hast taught them  to be  captains   and  as chief over thee  shall not sorrows take thee  as a woman in travail  
22 	and if thou say in thine heart  wherefore come these things upon me  for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered   and  thy heels made bare  
23	can the ethiopian change his skin  or the leopard his spots   then  may ye also do good  that are accustomed to do evil  
24	therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness  
25	this  is  thy lot  the portion of thy measures from me  saith the lord  because thou hast forgotten me  and trusted in falsehood  
26	therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face  that thy shame may appear  
27	i have seen thine adulteries  and thy neighings  the lewdness of thy whoredom   and  thine abominations on the hills in the fields  woe unto thee  o jerusalem  wilt thou not be made clean  when  shall it  once  be   
jeremiah 14
1 	the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth  
2	judah mourneth  and the gates thereof languish  they are black unto the ground  and the cry of jerusalem is gone up  
3	and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters  they came to the pits   and  found no water  they returned with their vessels empty  they were ashamed and confounded  and covered their heads  
4	because the ground is chapt  for there was no rain in the earth  the plowmen were ashamed  they covered their heads  
5	yea  the hind also calved in the field  and forsook  it   because there was no grass  
6	and the wild asses did stand in the high places  they snuffed up the wind like dragons  their eyes did fail  because  there was  no grass  
7	o lord  though our iniquities testify against us  do thou  it  for thy name s sake  for our backslidings are many  we have sinned against thee  
8	o the hope of israel  the saviour thereof in time of trouble  why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land  and as a wayfaring man  that  turneth aside to tarry for a night  
9	why shouldest thou be as a man astonied  as a mighty man  that  cannot save  yet thou  o lord   art  in the midst of us  and we are called by thy name  leave us not  
10 	thus saith the lord unto this people  thus have they loved to wander  they have not refrained their feet  therefore the lord doth not accept them  he will now remember their iniquity  and visit their sins  
11	then said the lord unto me  pray not for this people for  their  good  
12	when they fast  i will not hear their cry  and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation  i will not accept them  but i will consume them by the sword  and by the famine  and by the pestilence  
13	then said i  ah  lord god  behold  the prophets say unto them  ye shall not see the sword  neither shall ye have famine  but i will give you assured peace in this place  
14	then the lord said unto me  the prophets prophesy lies in my name  i sent them not  neither have i commanded them  neither spake unto them  they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination  and a thing of nought  and the deceit of their heart  
15	therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name  and i sent them not  yet they say  sword and famine shall not be in this land  by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed  
16	and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword  and they shall have none to bury them  them  their wives  nor their sons  nor their daughters  for i will pour their wickedness upon them  
17 	therefore thou shalt say this word unto them  let mine eyes run down with tears night and day  and let them not cease  for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach  with a very grievous blow  
18	if i go forth into the field  then behold the slain with the sword  and if i enter into the city  then behold them that are sick with famine  yea  both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not  
19	hast thou utterly rejected judah  hath thy soul lothed zion  why hast thou smitten us  and  there is  no healing for us  we looked for peace  and  there is  no good  and for the time of healing  and behold trouble  
20	we acknowledge  o lord  our wickedness   and  the iniquity of our fathers  for we have sinned against thee  
21	do not abhor  us   for thy name s sake  do not disgrace the throne of thy glory  remember  break not thy covenant with us  
22	are there  any  among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain  or can the heavens give showers   art  not thou he  o lord our god  therefore we will wait upon thee  for thou hast made all these  things   
jeremiah 15
1 	then said the lord unto me  though moses and samuel stood before me   yet  my mind  could  not  be  toward this people  cast  them  out of my sight  and let them go forth  
2	and it shall come to pass  if they say unto thee  whither shall we go forth  then thou shalt tell them  thus saith the lord  such as  are  for death  to death  and such as  are  for the sword  to the sword  and such as  are  for the famine  to the famine  and such as  are  for the captivity  to the captivity  
3	and i will appoint over them four kinds  saith the lord  the sword to slay  and the dogs to tear  and the fowls of the heaven  and the beasts of the earth  to devour and destroy  
4	and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth  because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah  for  that  which he did in jerusalem  
5	for who shall have pity upon thee  o jerusalem  or who shall bemoan thee  or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest  
6	thou hast forsaken me  saith the lord  thou art gone backward  therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee  and destroy thee  i am weary with repenting  
7	and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land  i will bereave  them  of children  i will destroy my people   since  they return not from their ways  
8	their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas  i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday  i have caused  him  to fall upon it suddenly  and terrors upon the city  
9	she that hath borne seven languisheth  she hath given up the ghost  her sun is gone down while  it was  yet day  she hath been ashamed and confounded  and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies  saith the lord  
10 	woe is me  my mother  that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth  i have neither lent on usury  nor men have lent to me on usury   yet  every one of them doth curse me  
11	the lord said  verily it shall be well with thy remnant  verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee  well  in the time of evil and in the time of affliction  
12	shall iron break the northern iron and the steel  
13	thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price  and  that  for all thy sins  even in all thy borders  
14	and i will make  thee  to pass with thine enemies into a land  which  thou knowest not  for a fire is kindled in mine anger   which  shall burn upon you  
15 	o lord  thou knowest  remember me  and visit me  and revenge me of my persecutors  take me not away in thy longsuffering  know that for thy sake i have suffered rebuke  
16	thy words were found  and i did eat them  and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart  for i am called by thy name  o lord god of hosts  
17	i sat not in the assembly of the mockers  nor rejoiced  i sat alone because of thy hand  for thou hast filled me with indignation  
18	why is my pain perpetual  and my wound incurable   which  refuseth to be healed  wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar   and as  waters  that  fail  
19	therefore thus saith the lord  if thou return  then will i bring thee again   and  thou shalt stand before me  and if thou take forth the precious from the vile  thou shalt be as my mouth  let them return unto thee  but return not thou unto them  
20	and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall  and they shall fight against thee  but they shall not prevail against thee  for i  am  with thee to save thee and to deliver thee  saith the lord  
21	and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked  and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible  
jeremiah 16
1 	the word of the lord came also unto me  saying  
2	thou shalt not take thee a wife  neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place  
3	for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place  and concerning their mothers that bare them  and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land  
4	they shall die of grievous deaths  they shall not be lamented  neither shall they be buried   but  they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth  and they shall be consumed by the sword  and by famine  and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven  and for the beasts of the earth  
5	for thus saith the lord  enter not into the house of mourning  neither go to lament nor bemoan them  for i have taken away my peace from this people  saith the lord   even  lovingkindness and mercies  
6	both the great and the small shall die in this land  they shall not be buried  neither shall  men  lament for them  nor cut themselves  nor make themselves bald for them  
7	neither shall  men  tear  themselves  for them in mourning  to comfort them for the dead  neither shall  men  give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother  
8	thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting  to sit with them to eat and to drink  
9	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes  and in your days  the voice of mirth  and the voice of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom  and the voice of the bride  
10 	and it shall come to pass  when thou shalt shew this people all these words  and they shall say unto thee  wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us  or what  is  our iniquity  or what  is  our sin that we have committed against the lord our god  
11	then shalt thou say unto them  because your fathers have forsaken me  saith the lord  and have walked after other gods  and have served them  and have worshipped them  and have forsaken me  and have not kept my law  
12	and ye have done worse than your fathers  for  behold  ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart  that they may not hearken unto me  
13	therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not   neither  ye nor your fathers  and there shall ye serve other gods day and night  where i will not shew you favour  
14 	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that it shall no more be said  the lord liveth  that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt  
15	but  the lord liveth  that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north  and from all the lands whither he had driven them  and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers  
16	behold  i will send for many fishers  saith the lord  and they shall fish them  and after will i send for many hunters  and they shall hunt them from every mountain  and from every hill  and out of the holes of the rocks  
17	for mine eyes  are  upon all their ways  they are not hid from my face  neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes  
18	and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double  because they have defiled my land  they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things  
19	o lord  my strength  and my fortress  and my refuge in the day of affliction  the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth  and shall say  surely our fathers have inherited lies  vanity  and  things  wherein  there is  no profit  
20	shall a man make gods unto himself  and they  are  no gods  
21	therefore  behold  i will this once cause them to know  i will cause them to know mine hand and my might  and they shall know that my name  is  the lord  
jeremiah 17
1 	the sin of judah  is  written with a pen of iron   and  with the point of a diamond   it is  graven upon the table of their heart  and upon the horns of your altars  
2	whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills  
3	o my mountain in the field  i will give thy substance  and  all thy treasures to the spoil   and  thy high places for sin  throughout all thy borders  
4	and thou  even thyself  shalt discontinue from thine heritage that i gave thee  and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not  for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger   which  shall burn for ever  
5 	thus saith the lord  cursed  be  the man that trusteth in man  and maketh flesh his arm  and whose heart departeth from the lord  
6	for he shall be like the heath in the desert  and shall not see when good cometh  but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness   in  a salt land and not inhabited  
7	blessed  is  the man that trusteth in the lord  and whose hope the lord is  
8	for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters  and  that  spreadeth out her roots by the river  and shall not see when heat cometh  but her leaf shall be green  and shall not be careful in the year of drought  neither shall cease from yielding fruit  
9	the heart  is  deceitful above all  things   and desperately wicked  who can know it  
10	i the lord search the heart   i  try the reins  even to give every man according to his ways   and  according to the fruit of his doings  
11	 as  the partridge sitteth  on eggs   and hatcheth  them  not   so  he that getteth riches  and not by right  shall leave them in the midst of his days  and at his end shall be a fool  
12 	a glorious high throne from the beginning  is  the place of our sanctuary  
13	o lord  the hope of israel  all that forsake thee shall be ashamed   and  they that depart from me shall be written in the earth  because they have forsaken the lord  the fountain of living waters  
14	heal me  o lord  and i shall be healed  save me  and i shall be saved  for thou  art  my praise  
15	behold  they say unto me  where  is  the word of the lord  let it come now  
16	as for me  i have not hastened from  being  a pastor to follow thee  neither have i desired the woeful day  thou knowest  that which came out of my lips was  right  before thee  
17	be not a terror unto me  thou  art  my hope in the day of evil  
18	let them be confounded that persecute me  but let not me be confounded  let them be dismayed  but let not me be dismayed  bring upon them the day of evil  and destroy them with double destruction  
19 	thus said the lord unto me  go and stand in the gate of the children of the people  whereby the kings of judah come in  and by the which they go out  and in all the gates of jerusalem  
20	and say unto them  hear ye the word of the lord  ye kings of judah  and all judah  and all the inhabitants of jerusalem  that enter in by these gates  
21	thus saith the lord  take heed to yourselves  and bear no burden on the sabbath day  nor bring  it  in by the gates of jerusalem  
22	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day  neither do ye any work  but hallow ye the sabbath day  as i commanded your fathers  
23	but they obeyed not  neither inclined their ear  but made their neck stiff  that they might not hear  nor receive instruction  
24	and it shall come to pass  if ye diligently hearken unto me  saith the lord  to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day  but hallow the sabbath day  to do no work therein  
25	then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david  riding in chariots and on horses  they  and their princes  the men of judah  and the inhabitants of jerusalem  and this city shall remain for ever  
26	and they shall come from the cities of judah  and from the places about jerusalem  and from the land of benjamin  and from the plain  and from the mountains  and from the south  bringing burnt offerings  and sacrifices  and meat offerings  and incense  and bringing sacrifices of praise  unto the house of the lord  
27	but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day  and not to bear a burden  even entering in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day  then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof  and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem  and it shall not be quenched  
jeremiah 18
1 	the word which came to jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	arise  and go down to the potter s house  and there i will cause thee to hear my words  
3	then i went down to the potter s house  and  behold  he wrought a work on the wheels  
4	and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter  so he made it again another vessel  as seemed good to the potter to make  it   
5	then the word of the lord came to me  saying  
6	o house of israel  cannot i do with you as this potter  saith the lord  behold  as the clay  is  in the potter s hand  so  are  ye in mine hand  o house of israel  
7	 at what  instant i shall speak concerning a nation  and concerning a kingdom  to pluck up  and to pull down  and to destroy  it   
8	if that nation  against whom i have pronounced  turn from their evil  i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them  
9	and  at what  instant i shall speak concerning a nation  and concerning a kingdom  to build and to plant  it   
10	if it do evil in my sight  that it obey not my voice  then i will repent of the good  wherewith i said i would benefit them  
11 	now therefore go to  speak to the men of judah  and to the inhabitants of jerusalem  saying  thus saith the lord  behold  i frame evil against you  and devise a device against you  return ye now every one from his evil way  and make your ways and your doings good  
12	and they said  there is no hope  but we will walk after our own devices  and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart  
13	therefore thus saith the lord  ask ye now among the heathen  who hath heard such things  the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing  
14	will  a man  leave the snow of lebanon  which cometh  from the rock of the field   or  shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken  
15	because my people hath forgotten me  they have burned incense to vanity  and they have caused them to stumble in their ways  from  the ancient paths  to walk in paths   in  a way not cast up  
16	to make their land desolate   and  a perpetual hissing  every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished  and wag his head  
17	i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy  i will shew them the back  and not the face  in the day of their calamity  
18 	then said they  come  and let us devise devices against jeremiah  for the law shall not perish from the priest  nor counsel from the wise  nor the word from the prophet  come  and let us smite him with the tongue  and let us not give heed to any of his words  
19	give heed to me  o lord  and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me  
20	shall evil be recompensed for good  for they have digged a pit for my soul  remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them   and  to turn away thy wrath from them  
21	therefore deliver up their children to the famine  and pour out their  blood  by the force of the sword  and let their wives be bereaved of their children  and  be  widows  and let their men be put to death   let  their young men  be  slain by the sword in battle  
22	let a cry be heard from their houses  when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them  for they have digged a pit to take me  and hid snares for my feet  
23	yet  lord  thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay  me   forgive not their iniquity  neither blot out their sin from thy sight  but let them be overthrown before thee  deal  thus  with them in the time of thine anger  
jeremiah 19
1 	thus saith the lord  go and get a potter s earthen bottle  and  take  of the ancients of the people  and of the ancients of the priests  
2	and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom  which  is  by the entry of the east gate  and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee  
3	and say  hear ye the word of the lord  o kings of judah  and inhabitants of jerusalem  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will bring evil upon this place  the which whosoever heareth  his ears shall tingle  
4	because they have forsaken me  and have estranged this place  and have burned incense in it unto other gods  whom neither they nor their fathers have known  nor the kings of judah  and have filled this place with the blood of innocents  
5	they have built also the high places of baal  to burn their sons with fire  for  burnt offerings unto baal  which i commanded not  nor spake  it   neither came  it  into my mind  
6	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that this place shall no more be called tophet  nor the valley of the son of hinnom  but the valley of slaughter  
7	and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place  and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies  and by the hands of them that seek their lives  and their carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven  and for the beasts of the earth  
8	and i will make this city desolate  and an hissing  every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof  
9	and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters  and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness  wherewith their enemies  and they that seek their lives  shall straiten them  
10 	then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee  
11	and shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord of hosts  even so will i break this people and this city  as  one  breaketh a potter s vessel  that cannot be made whole again  and they shall bury  them  in tophet  till  there be  no place to bury  
12	thus will i do unto this place  saith the lord  and to the inhabitants thereof  and  even  make this city as tophet  
13	and the houses of jerusalem  and the houses of the kings of judah  shall be defiled as the place of tophet  because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven  and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods  
14	then came jeremiah from tophet  whither the lord had sent him to prophesy  and he stood in the court of the lord s house  and said to all the people  
15	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it  because they have hardened their necks  that they might not hear my words  
jeremiah 20
1 	now pashur the son of immer the priest  who  was  also chief governor in the house of the lord  heard that jeremiah prophesied these things  
2	then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet  and put him in the stocks that  were  in the high gate of benjamin  which  was  by the house of the lord  
3	and it came to pass on the morrow  that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks  then said jeremiah unto him  the lord hath not called thy name pashur  but magormissabib  
4	for thus saith the lord  behold  i will make thee a terror to thyself  and to all thy friends  and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies  and thine eyes shall behold  it   and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall carry them captive into babylon  and shall slay them with the sword  
5	moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city  and all the labours thereof  and all the precious things thereof  and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies  which shall spoil them  and take them  and carry them to babylon  
6	and thou  pashur  and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity  and thou shalt come to babylon  and there thou shalt die  and shalt be buried there  thou  and all thy friends  to whom thou hast prophesied lies  
7 	o lord  thou hast deceived me  and i was deceived  thou art stronger than i  and hast prevailed  i am in derision daily  every one mocketh me  
8	for since i spake  i cried out  i cried violence and spoil  because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me  and a derision  daily  
9	then i said  i will not make mention of him  nor speak any more in his name  but  his word  was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones  and i was weary with forbearing  and i could not  stay   
10	for i heard the defaming of many  fear on every side  report   say they   and we will report it  all my familiars watched for my halting   saying   peradventure he will be enticed  and we shall prevail against him  and we shall take our revenge on him  
11	but the lord  is  with me as a mighty terrible one  therefore my persecutors shall stumble  and they shall not prevail  they shall be greatly ashamed  for they shall not prosper   their  everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten  
12	but  o lord of hosts  that triest the righteous   and  seest the reins and the heart  let me see thy vengeance on them  for unto thee have i opened my cause  
13	sing unto the lord  praise ye the lord  for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers  
14 	cursed  be  the day wherein i was born  let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed  
15	cursed  be  the man who brought tidings to my father  saying  a man child is born unto thee  making him very glad  
16	and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew  and repented not  and let him hear the cry in the morning  and the shouting at noontide  
17	because he slew me not from the womb  or that my mother might have been my grave  and her womb  to be  always great  with me   
18	wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow  that my days should be consumed with shame  
jeremiah 21
1 	the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord  when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah  and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest  saying  
2	enquire  i pray thee  of the lord for us  for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us  if so be that the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works  that he may go up from us  
3	then said jeremiah unto them  thus shall ye say to zedekiah  
4	thus saith the lord god of israel  behold  i will turn back the weapons of war that  are  in your hands  wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon  and  against  the chaldeans  which besiege you without the walls  and i will assemble them into the midst of this city  
5	and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm  even in anger  and in fury  and in great wrath  
6	and i will smite the inhabitants of this city  both man and beast  they shall die of a great pestilence  
7	and afterward  saith the lord  i will deliver zedekiah king of judah  and his servants  and the people  and such as are left in this city from the pestilence  from the sword  and from the famine  into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and into the hand of their enemies  and into the hand of those that seek their life  and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword  he shall not spare them  neither have pity  nor have mercy  
8 	and unto this people thou shalt say  thus saith the lord  behold  i set before you the way of life  and the way of death  
9	he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword  and by the famine  and by the pestilence  but he that goeth out  and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you  he shall live  and his life shall be unto him for a prey  
10	for i have set my face against this city for evil  and not for good  saith the lord  it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall burn it with fire  
11	and touching the house of the king of judah   say   hear ye the word of the lord  
12	o house of david  thus saith the lord  execute judgment in the morning  and deliver  him that is  spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor  lest my fury go out like fire  and burn that none can quench  it   because of the evil of your doings  
13	behold  i  am  against thee  o inhabitant of the valley   and  rock of the plain  saith the lord  which say  who shall come down against us  or who shall enter into our habitations  
14	but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings  saith the lord  and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof  and it shall devour all things round about it  
jeremiah 22
1 	thus saith the lord  go down to the house of the king of judah  and speak there this word  
2	and say  hear the word of the lord  o king of judah  that sittest upon the throne of david  thou  and thy servants  and thy people that enter in by these gates  
3	thus saith the lord  execute ye judgment and righteousness  and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor  and do no wrong  do no violence to the stranger  the fatherless  nor the widow  neither shed innocent blood in this place  
4	for if ye do this thing indeed  then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david  riding in chariots and on horses  he  and his servants  and his people  
5	but if ye will not hear these words  i swear by myself  saith the lord  that this house shall become a desolation  
6	for thus saith the lord unto the king s house of judah  thou  art  gilead unto me   and  the head of lebanon   yet  surely i will make thee a wilderness   and  cities  which  are not inhabited  
7	and i will prepare destroyers against thee  every one with his weapons  and they shall cut down thy choice cedars  and cast  them  into the fire  
8	and many nations shall pass by this city  and they shall say every man to his neighbour  wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city  
9	then they shall answer  because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god  and worshipped other gods  and served them  
10 	weep ye not for the dead  neither bemoan him   but  weep sore for him that goeth away  for he shall return no more  nor see his native country  
11	for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah  which reigned instead of josiah his father  which went forth out of this place  he shall not return thither any more  
12	but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive  and shall see this land no more  
13	woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness  and his chambers by wrong   that  useth his neighbour s service without wages  and giveth him not for his work  
14	that saith  i will build me a wide house and large chambers  and cutteth him out windows  and  it is  cieled with cedar  and painted with vermilion  
15	shalt thou reign  because thou closest  thyself  in cedar  did not thy father eat and drink  and do judgment and justice   and  then  it was  well with him  
16	he judged the cause of the poor and needy  then  it was  well  with him  was  not this to know me  saith the lord  
17	but thine eyes and thine heart  are  not but for thy covetousness  and for to shed innocent blood  and for oppression  and for violence  to do  it   
18	therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  they shall not lament for him   saying   ah my brother  or  ah sister  they shall not lament for him   saying   ah lord  or  ah his glory  
19	he shall be buried with the burial of an ass  drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem  
20 	go up to lebanon  and cry  and lift up thy voice in bashan  and cry from the passages  for all thy lovers are destroyed  
21	i spake unto thee in thy prosperity   but  thou saidst  i will not hear  this  hath been  thy manner from thy youth  that thou obeyedst not my voice  
22	the wind shall eat up all thy pastors  and thy lovers shall go into captivity  surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness  
23	o inhabitant of lebanon  that makest thy nest in the cedars  how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee  the pain as of a woman in travail  
24	 as  i live  saith the lord  though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand  yet would i pluck thee thence  
25	and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life  and into the hand  of them  whose face thou fearest  even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and into the hand of the chaldeans  
26	and i will cast thee out  and thy mother that bare thee  into another country  where ye were not born  and there shall ye die  
27	but to the land whereunto they desire to return  thither shall they not return  
28	 is  this man coniah a despised broken idol   is he  a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure  wherefore are they cast out  he and his seed  and are cast into a land which they know not  
29	o earth  earth  earth  hear the word of the lord  
30	thus saith the lord  write ye this man childless  a man  that  shall not prosper in his days  for no man of his seed shall prosper  sitting upon the throne of david  and ruling any more in judah  
jeremiah 23
1 	woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture  saith the lord  
2	therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people  ye have scattered my flock  and driven them away  and have not visited them  behold  i will visit upon you the evil of your doings  saith the lord  
3	and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them  and will bring them again to their folds  and they shall be fruitful and increase  
4	and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them  and they shall fear no more  nor be dismayed  neither shall they be lacking  saith the lord  
5	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will raise unto david a righteous branch  and a king shall reign and prosper  and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth  
6	in his days judah shall be saved  and israel shall dwell safely  and this  is  his name whereby he shall be called  the lord our righteousness  
7	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that they shall no more say  the lord liveth  which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt  
8	but  the lord liveth  which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country  and from all countries whither i had driven them  and they shall dwell in their own land  
9 	mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets  all my bones shake  i am like a drunken man  and like a man whom wine hath overcome  because of the lord  and because of the words of his holiness  
10	for the land is full of adulterers  for because of swearing the land mourneth  the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up  and their course is evil  and their force  is  not right  
11	for both prophet and priest are profane  yea  in my house have i found their wickedness  saith the lord  
12	wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery  ways  in the darkness  they shall be driven on  and fall therein  for i will bring evil upon them   even  the year of their visitation  saith the lord  
13	and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria  they prophesied in baal  and caused my people israel to err  
14	i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing  they commit adultery  and walk in lies  they strengthen also the hands of evildoers  that none doth return from his wickedness  they are all of them unto me as sodom  and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah  
15	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets  behold  i will feed them with wormwood  and make them drink the water of gall  for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land  
16	thus saith the lord of hosts  hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you  they make you vain  they speak a vision of their own heart   and  not out of the mouth of the lord  
17	they say still unto them that despise me  the lord hath said  ye shall have peace  and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart  no evil shall come upon you  
18	for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord  and hath perceived and heard his word  who hath marked his word  and heard  it   
19	behold  a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury  even a grievous whirlwind  it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked  
20	the anger of the lord shall not return  until he have executed  and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart  in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly  
21	i have not sent these prophets  yet they ran  i have not spoken to them  yet they prophesied  
22	but if they had stood in my counsel  and had caused my people to hear my words  then they should have turned them from their evil way  and from the evil of their doings  
23	 am  i a god at hand  saith the lord  and not a god afar off  
24	can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him  saith the lord  do not i fill heaven and earth  saith the lord  
25	i have heard what the prophets said  that prophesy lies in my name  saying  i have dreamed  i have dreamed  
26	how long shall  this  be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies  yea   they are  prophets of the deceit of their own heart  
27	which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour  as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal  
28	the prophet that hath a dream  let him tell a dream  and he that hath my word  let him speak my word faithfully  what  is  the chaff to the wheat  saith the lord  
29	 is  not my word like as a fire  saith the lord  and like a hammer  that  breaketh the rock in pieces  
30	therefore  behold  i  am  against the prophets  saith the lord  that steal my words every one from his neighbour  
31	behold  i  am  against the prophets  saith the lord  that use their tongues  and say  he saith  
32	behold  i  am  against them that prophesy false dreams  saith the lord  and do tell them  and cause my people to err by their lies  and by their lightness  yet i sent them not  nor commanded them  therefore they shall not profit this people at all  saith the lord  
33 	and when this people  or the prophet  or a priest  shall ask thee  saying  what  is  the burden of the lord  thou shalt then say unto them  what burden  i will even forsake you  saith the lord  
34	and  as for  the prophet  and the priest  and the people  that shall say  the burden of the lord  i will even punish that man and his house  
35	thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour  and every one to his brother  what hath the lord answered  and  what hath the lord spoken  
36	and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more  for every man s word shall be his burden  for ye have perverted the words of the living god  of the lord of hosts our god  
37	thus shalt thou say to the prophet  what hath the lord answered thee  and  what hath the lord spoken  
38	but since ye say  the burden of the lord  therefore thus saith the lord  because ye say this word  the burden of the lord  and i have sent unto you  saying  ye shall not say  the burden of the lord  
39	therefore  behold  i  even i  will utterly forget you  and i will forsake you  and the city that i gave you and your fathers   and cast you  out of my presence  
40	and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you  and a perpetual shame  which shall not be forgotten  
jeremiah 24
1 	the lord shewed me  and  behold  two baskets of figs  were  set before the temple of the lord  after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah  and the princes of judah  with the carpenters and smiths  from jerusalem  and had brought them to babylon  
2	one basket  had  very good figs   even  like the figs  that are  first ripe  and the other basket  had  very naughty figs  which could not be eaten  they were so bad  
3	then said the lord unto me  what seest thou  jeremiah  and i said  figs  the good figs  very good  and the evil  very evil  that cannot be eaten  they are so evil  
4	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
5	thus saith the lord  the god of israel  like these good figs  so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah  whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for  their  good  
6	for i will set mine eyes upon them for good  and i will bring them again to this land  and i will build them  and not pull  them  down  and i will plant them  and not pluck  them  up  
7	and i will give them an heart to know me  that i  am  the lord  and they shall be my people  and i will be their god  for they shall return unto me with their whole heart  
8	and as the evil figs  which cannot be eaten  they are so evil  surely thus saith the lord  so will i give zedekiah the king of judah  and his princes  and the residue of jerusalem  that remain in this land  and them that dwell in the land of egypt  
9	and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for  their  hurt   to be  a reproach and a proverb  a taunt and a curse  in all places whither i shall drive them  
10	and i will send the sword  the famine  and the pestilence  among them  till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers  
jeremiah 25
1 	the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  that  was  the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  
2	the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah  and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem  saying  
3	from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah  even unto this day  that  is  the three and twentieth year  the word of the lord hath come unto me  and i have spoken unto you  rising early and speaking  but ye have not hearkened  
4	and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets  rising early and sending  them   but ye have not hearkened  nor inclined your ear to hear  
5	they said  turn ye again now every one from his evil way  and from the evil of your doings  and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever  
6	and go not after other gods to serve them  and to worship them  and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands  and i will do you no hurt  
7	yet ye have not hearkened unto me  saith the lord  that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt  
8 	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  because ye have not heard my words  
9	behold  i will send and take all the families of the north  saith the lord  and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and will bring them against this land  and against the inhabitants thereof  and against all these nations round about  and will utterly destroy them  and make them an astonishment  and an hissing  and perpetual desolations  
10	moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth  and the voice of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom  and the voice of the bride  the sound of the millstones  and the light of the candle  
11	and this whole land shall be a desolation   and  an astonishment  and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years  
12	and it shall come to pass  when seventy years are accomplished   that  i will punish the king of babylon  and that nation  saith the lord  for their iniquity  and the land of the chaldeans  and will make it perpetual desolations  
13	and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it   even  all that is written in this book  which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations  
14	for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also  and i will recompense them according to their deeds  and according to the works of their own hands  
15 	for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me  take the wine cup of this fury at my hand  and cause all the nations  to whom i send thee  to drink it  
16	and they shall drink  and be moved  and be mad  because of the sword that i will send among them  
17	then took i the cup at the lord s hand  and made all the nations to drink  unto whom the lord had sent me  
18	 to wit   jerusalem  and the cities of judah  and the kings thereof  and the princes thereof  to make them a desolation  an astonishment  an hissing  and a curse  as  it is  this day  
19	pharaoh king of egypt  and his servants  and his princes  and all his people  
20	and all the mingled people  and all the kings of the land of uz  and all the kings of the land of the philistines  and ashkelon  and azzah  and ekron  and the remnant of ashdod  
21	edom  and moab  and the children of ammon  
22	and all the kings of tyrus  and all the kings of zidon  and the kings of the isles which  are  beyond the sea  
23	dedan  and tema  and buz  and all  that are  in the utmost corners  
24	and all the kings of arabia  and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert  
25	and all the kings of zimri  and all the kings of elam  and all the kings of the medes  
26	and all the kings of the north  far and near  one with another  and all the kingdoms of the world  which  are  upon the face of the earth  and the king of sheshach shall drink after them  
27	therefore thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  drink ye  and be drunken  and spue  and fall  and rise no more  because of the sword which i will send among you  
28	and it shall be  if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink  then shalt thou say unto them  thus saith the lord of hosts  ye shall certainly drink  
29	for  lo  i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name  and should ye be utterly unpunished  ye shall not be unpunished  for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth  saith the lord of hosts  
30 	therefore prophesy thou against them all these words  and say unto them  the lord shall roar from on high  and utter his voice from his holy habitation  he shall mightily roar upon his habitation  he shall give a shout  as they that tread  the grapes   against all the inhabitants of the earth  
31	a noise shall come  even  to the ends of the earth  for the lord hath a controversy with the nations  he will plead with all flesh  he will give them  that are  wicked to the sword  saith the lord  
32	thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  evil shall go forth from nation to nation  and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth  
33	and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from  one  end of the earth even unto the  other  end of the earth  they shall not be lamented  neither gathered  nor buried  they shall be dung upon the ground  
34	howl  ye shepherds  and cry  and wallow yourselves  in the ashes   ye principal of the flock  for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished  and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel  
35	and the shepherds shall have no way to flee  nor the principal of the flock to escape  
36	a voice of the cry of the shepherds  and an howling of the principal of the flock   shall be heard   for the lord hath spoiled their pasture  
37	and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord  
38	he hath forsaken his covert  as the lion  for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor  and because of his fierce anger  
jeremiah 26
1 	in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord  saying  
2	thus saith the lord  stand in the court of the lord s house  and speak unto all the cities of judah  which come to worship in the lord s house  all the words that i command thee to speak unto them  diminish not a word  
3	if so be they will hearken  and turn every man from his evil way  that i may repent me of the evil  which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings  
4	and thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord  if ye will not hearken to me  to walk in my law  which i have set before you  
5	to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets  whom i sent unto you  both rising up early  and sending  them   but ye have not hearkened  
6	then will i make this house like shiloh  and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth  
7 	so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord  
8	now it came to pass  when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded  him  to speak unto all the people  that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him  saying  thou shalt surely die  
9	why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord  saying  this house shall be like shiloh  and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant  and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord  
10	when the princes of judah heard these things  then they came up from the king s house unto the house of the lord  and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lord s  house   
11	then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people  saying  this man  is  worthy to die  for he hath prophesied against this city  as ye have heard with your ears  
12	then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people  saying  the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard  
13	therefore now amend your ways and your doings  and obey the voice of the lord your god  and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you  
14	as for me  behold  i  am  in your hand  do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you  
15	but know ye for certain  that if ye put me to death  ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves  and upon this city  and upon the inhabitants thereof  for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears  
16 	then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets  this man  is  not worthy to die  for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god  
17	then rose up certain of the elders of the land  and spake to all the assembly of the people  saying  
18	micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah  and spake to all the people of judah  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  zion shall be plowed  like  a field  and jerusalem shall become heaps  and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest  
19	did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death  did he not fear the lord  and besought the lord  and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them  thus might we procure great evil against our souls  
20	and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord  urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim  who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah  
21	and when jehoiakim the king  with all his mighty men  and all the princes  heard his words  the king sought to put him to death  but when urijah heard it  he was afraid  and fled  and went into egypt  
22	and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt   namely   elnathan the son of achbor  and  certain  men with him into egypt  
23	and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt  and brought him unto jehoiakim the king  who slew him with the sword  and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people  
24	nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah  that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death  
jeremiah 27
1 	in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	thus saith the lord to me  make thee bonds and yokes  and put them upon thy neck  
3	and send them to the king of edom  and to the king of moab  and to the king of the ammonites  and to the king of tyrus  and to the king of zidon  by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah  
4	and command them to say unto their masters  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  thus shall ye say unto your masters  
5	i have made the earth  the man and the beast that  are  upon the ground  by my great power and by my outstretched arm  and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me  
6	and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him  
7	and all nations shall serve him  and his son  and his son s son  until the very time of his land come  and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him  
8	and it shall come to pass   that  the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon  and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon  that nation will i punish  saith the lord  with the sword  and with the famine  and with the pestilence  until i have consumed them by his hand  
9	therefore hearken not ye to your prophets  nor to your diviners  nor to your dreamers  nor to your enchanters  nor to your sorcerers  which speak unto you  saying  ye shall not serve the king of babylon  
10	for they prophesy a lie unto you  to remove you far from your land  and that i should drive you out  and ye should perish  
11	but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon  and serve him  those will i let remain still in their own land  saith the lord  and they shall till it  and dwell therein  
12 	i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words  saying  bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon  and serve him and his people  and live  
13	why will ye die  thou and thy people  by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon  
14	therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you  saying  ye shall not serve the king of babylon  for they prophesy a lie unto you  
15	for i have not sent them  saith the lord  yet they prophesy a lie in my name  that i might drive you out  and that ye might perish  ye  and the prophets that prophesy unto you  
16	also i spake to the priests and to all this people  saying  thus saith the lord  hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you  saying  behold  the vessels of the lord s house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon  for they prophesy a lie unto you  
17	hearken not unto them  serve the king of babylon  and live  wherefore should this city be laid waste  
18	but if they  be  prophets  and if the word of the lord be with them  let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts  that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord  and  in  the house of the king of judah  and at jerusalem  go not to babylon  
19	for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars  and concerning the sea  and concerning the bases  and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city  
20	which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not  when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon  and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem  
21	yea  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  concerning the vessels that remain  in  the house of the lord  and  in  the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem  
22	they shall be carried to babylon  and there shall they be until the day that i visit them  saith the lord  then will i bring them up  and restore them to this place  
jeremiah 28
1 	and it came to pass the same year  in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah  in the fourth year   and  in the fifth month   that  hananiah the son of azur the prophet  which  was  of gibeon  spake unto me in the house of the lord  in the presence of the priests and of all the people  saying  
2	thus speaketh the lord of hosts  the god of israel  saying  i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon  
3	within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord s house  that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place  and carried them to babylon  
4	and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah  with all the captives of judah  that went into babylon  saith the lord  for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon  
5	then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests  and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord  
6	even the prophet jeremiah said  amen  the lord do so  the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied  to bring again the vessels of the lord s house  and all that is carried away captive  from babylon into this place  
7	nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears  and in the ears of all the people  
8	the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries  and against great kingdoms  of war  and of evil  and of pestilence  
9	the prophet which prophesieth of peace  when the word of the prophet shall come to pass   then  shall the prophet be known  that the lord hath truly sent him  
10 	then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah s neck  and brake it  
11	and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people  saying  thus saith the lord  even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years  and the prophet jeremiah went his way  
12	then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  the prophet   after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah  saying  
13	go and tell hananiah  saying  thus saith the lord  thou hast broken the yokes of wood  but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron  
14	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations  that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and they shall serve him  and i have given him the beasts of the field also  
15	then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet  hear now  hananiah  the lord hath not sent thee  but thou makest this people to trust in a lie  
16	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will cast thee from off the face of the earth  this year thou shalt die  because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord  
17	so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month  
jeremiah 29
1 	now these  are  the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives  and to the priests  and to the prophets  and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon  
2	 after that jeconiah the king  and the queen  and the eunuchs  the princes of judah and jerusalem  and the carpenters  and the smiths  were departed from jerusalem   
3	by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan  and gemariah the son of hilkiah   whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  saying  
4	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  unto all that are carried away captives  whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon  
5	build ye houses  and dwell  in them   and plant gardens  and eat the fruit of them  
6	take ye wives  and beget sons and daughters  and take wives for your sons  and give your daughters to husbands  that they may bear sons and daughters  that ye may be increased there  and not diminished  
7	and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives  and pray unto the lord for it  for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace  
8 	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  let not your prophets and your diviners  that  be  in the midst of you  deceive you  neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed  
9	for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name  i have not sent them  saith the lord  
10	for thus saith the lord  that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you  and perform my good word toward you  in causing you to return to this place  
11	for i know the thoughts that i think toward you  saith the lord  thoughts of peace  and not of evil  to give you an expected end  
12	then shall ye call upon me  and ye shall go and pray unto me  and i will hearken unto you  
13	and ye shall seek me  and find  me   when ye shall search for me with all your heart  
14	and i will be found of you  saith the lord  and i will turn away your captivity  and i will gather you from all the nations  and from all the places whither i have driven you  saith the lord  and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive  
15 	because ye have said  the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon  
16	 know  that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david  and of all the people that dwelleth in this city   and  of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity  
17	thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  i will send upon them the sword  the famine  and the pestilence  and will make them like vile figs  that cannot be eaten  they are so evil  
18	and i will persecute them with the sword  with the famine  and with the pestilence  and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth  to be a curse  and an astonishment  and an hissing  and a reproach  among all the nations whither i have driven them  
19	because they have not hearkened to my words  saith the lord  which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets  rising up early and sending  them   but ye would not hear  saith the lord  
20	hear ye therefore the word of the lord  all ye of the captivity  whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon  
21	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  of ahab the son of kolaiah  and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah  which prophesy a lie unto you in my name  behold  i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and he shall slay them before your eyes  
22	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which  are  in babylon  saying  the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab  whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire  
23	because they have committed villany in israel  and have committed adultery with their neighbours  wives  and have spoken lying words in my name  which i have not commanded them  even i know  and  am  a witness  saith the lord  
24 	 thus  shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite  saying  
25	thus speaketh the lord of hosts  the god of israel  saying  because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that  are  at jerusalem  and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest  and to all the priests  saying  
26	the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest  that ye should be officers in the house of the lord  for every man  that is  mad  and maketh himself a prophet  that thou shouldest put him in prison  and in the stocks  
27	now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth  which maketh himself a prophet to you  
28	for therefore he sent unto us  in  babylon  saying  this  captivity is  long  build ye houses  and dwell  in them   and plant gardens  and eat the fruit of them  
29	and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet  
30	then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  saying  
31	send to all them of the captivity  saying  thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite  because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you  and i sent him not  and he caused you to trust in a lie  
32	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite  and his seed  he shall not have a man to dwell among this people  neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people  saith the lord  because he hath taught rebellion against the lord  
jeremiah 30
1 	the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	thus speaketh the lord god of israel  saying  write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book  
3	for  lo  the days come  saith the lord  that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah  saith the lord  and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers  and they shall possess it  
4	and these  are  the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah  
5	for thus saith the lord  we have heard a voice of trembling  of fear  and not of peace  
6	ask ye now  and see whether a man doth travail with child  wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins  as a woman in travail  and all faces are turned into paleness  
7	alas  for that day  is  great  so that none  is  like it  it  is  even the time of jacob s trouble  but he shall be saved out of it  
8	for it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord of hosts   that  i will break his yoke from off thy neck  and will burst thy bonds  and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him  
9	but they shall serve the lord their god  and david their king  whom i will raise up unto them  
10 	therefore fear thou not  o my servant jacob  saith the lord  neither be dismayed  o israel  for  lo  i will save thee from afar  and thy seed from the land of their captivity  and jacob shall return  and shall be in rest  and be quiet  and none shall make  him  afraid  
11	for i  am  with thee  saith the lord  to save thee  though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee  yet will i not make a full end of thee  but i will correct thee in measure  and will not leave thee altogether unpunished  
12	for thus saith the lord  thy bruise  is  incurable   and  thy wound  is  grievous  
13	 there is  none to plead thy cause  that thou mayest be bound up  thou hast no healing medicines  
14	all thy lovers have forgotten thee  they seek thee not  for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy  with the chastisement of a cruel one  for the multitude of thine iniquity   because  thy sins were increased  
15	why criest thou for thine affliction  thy sorrow  is  incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity   because  thy sins were increased  i have done these things unto thee  
16	therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured  and all thine adversaries  every one of them  shall go into captivity  and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil  and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey  
17	for i will restore health unto thee  and i will heal thee of thy wounds  saith the lord  because they called thee an outcast   saying   this  is  zion  whom no man seeketh after  
18 	thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring again the captivity of jacob s tents  and have mercy on his dwellingplaces  and the city shall be builded upon her own heap  and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof  
19	and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry  and i will multiply them  and they shall not be few  i will also glorify them  and they shall not be small  
20	their children also shall be as aforetime  and their congregation shall be established before me  and i will punish all that oppress them  
21	and their nobles shall be of themselves  and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them  and i will cause him to draw near  and he shall approach unto me  for who  is  this that engaged his heart to approach unto me  saith the lord  
22	and ye shall be my people  and i will be your god  
23	behold  the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury  a continuing whirlwind  it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked  
24	the fierce anger of the lord shall not return  until he have done  it   and until he have performed the intents of his heart  in the latter days ye shall consider it  
jeremiah 31
1 	at the same time  saith the lord  will i be the god of all the families of israel  and they shall be my people  
2	thus saith the lord  the people  which were  left of the sword found grace in the wilderness   even  israel  when i went to cause him to rest  
3	the lord hath appeared of old unto me   saying   yea  i have loved thee with an everlasting love  therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee  
4	again i will build thee  and thou shalt be built  o virgin of israel  thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets  and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry  
5	thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria  the planters shall plant  and shall eat  them  as common things  
6	for there shall be a day   that  the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry  arise ye  and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god  
7	for thus saith the lord  sing with gladness for jacob  and shout among the chief of the nations  publish ye  praise ye  and say  o lord  save thy people  the remnant of israel  
8	behold  i will bring them from the north country  and gather them from the coasts of the earth   and  with them the blind and the lame  the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together  a great company shall return thither  
9	they shall come with weeping  and with supplications will i lead them  i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way  wherein they shall not stumble  for i am a father to israel  and ephraim  is  my firstborn  
10 	hear the word of the lord  o ye nations  and declare  it  in the isles afar off  and say  he that scattered israel will gather him  and keep him  as a shepherd  doth  his flock  
11	for the lord hath redeemed jacob  and ransomed him from the hand of  him that was  stronger than he  
12	therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion  and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord  for wheat  and for wine  and for oil  and for the young of the flock and of the herd  and their soul shall be as a watered garden  and they shall not sorrow any more at all  
13	then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance  both young men and old together  for i will turn their mourning into joy  and will comfort them  and make them rejoice from their sorrow  
14	and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness  and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness  saith the lord  
15	thus saith the lord  a voice was heard in ramah  lamentation   and  bitter weeping  rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children  because they  were  not  
16	thus saith the lord  refrain thy voice from weeping  and thine eyes from tears  for thy work shall be rewarded  saith the lord  and they shall come again from the land of the enemy  
17	and there is hope in thine end  saith the lord  that thy children shall come again to their own border  
18 	i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself  thus   thou hast chastised me  and i was chastised  as a bullock unaccustomed  to the yoke   turn thou me  and i shall be turned  for thou  art  the lord my god  
19	surely after that i was turned  i repented  and after that i was instructed  i smote upon  my  thigh  i was ashamed  yea  even confounded  because i did bear the reproach of my youth  
20	 is  ephraim my dear son   is he  a pleasant child  for since i spake against him  i do earnestly remember him still  therefore my bowels are troubled for him  i will surely have mercy upon him  saith the lord  
21	set thee up waymarks  make thee high heaps  set thine heart toward the highway   even  the way  which  thou wentest  turn again  o virgin of israel  turn again to these thy cities  
22	how long wilt thou go about  o thou backsliding daughter  for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth  a woman shall compass a man  
23	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof  when i shall bring again their captivity  the lord bless thee  o habitation of justice   and  mountain of holiness  
24	and there shall dwell in judah itself  and in all the cities thereof together  husbandmen  and they  that  go forth with flocks  
25	for i have satiated the weary soul  and i have replenished every sorrowful soul  
26	upon this i awaked  and beheld  and my sleep was sweet unto me  
27 	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man  and with the seed of beast  
28	and it shall come to pass   that  like as i have watched over them  to pluck up  and to break down  and to throw down  and to destroy  and to afflict  so will i watch over them  to build  and to plant  saith the lord  
29	in those days they shall say no more  the fathers have eaten a sour grape  and the children s teeth are set on edge  
30	but every one shall die for his own iniquity  every man that eateth the sour grape  his teeth shall be set on edge  
31	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel  and with the house of judah  
32	not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day  that  i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt  which my covenant they brake  although i was an husband unto them  saith the lord  
33	but this  shall be  the covenant that i will make with the house of israel  after those days  saith the lord  i will put my law in their inward parts  and write it in their hearts  and will be their god  and they shall be my people  
34	and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour  and every man his brother  saying  know the lord  for they shall all know me  from the least of them unto the greatest of them  saith the lord  for i will forgive their iniquity  and i will remember their sin no more  
35 	thus saith the lord  which giveth the sun for a light by day   and  the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night  which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar  the lord of hosts  is  his name  
36	if those ordinances depart from before me  saith the lord   then  the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever  
37	thus saith the lord  if heaven above can be measured  and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath  i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done  saith the lord  
38	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner  
39	and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb  and shall compass about to goath  
40	and the whole valley of the dead bodies  and of the ashes  and all the fields unto the brook of kidron  unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east   shall be  holy unto the lord  it shall not be plucked up  nor thrown down any more for ever  
jeremiah 32
1 	the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah  which  was  the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar  
2	for then the king of babylon s army besieged jerusalem  and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison  which  was  in the king of judah s house  
3	for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up  saying  wherefore dost thou prophesy  and say  thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall take it  
4	and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans  but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon  and shall speak with him mouth to mouth  and his eyes shall behold his eyes  
5	and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon  and there shall he be until i visit him  saith the lord  though ye fight with the chaldeans  ye shall not prosper  
6	and jeremiah said  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
7	behold  hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee  saying  buy thee my field that  is  in anathoth  for the right of redemption  is  thine to buy  it   
8	so hanameel mine uncle s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord  and said unto me  buy my field  i pray thee  that  is  in anathoth  which  is  in the country of benjamin  for the right of inheritance  is  thine  and the redemption  is  thine  buy  it  for thyself  then i knew that this  was  the word of the lord  
9	and i bought the field of hanameel my uncle s son  that  was  in anathoth  and weighed him the money   even  seventeen shekels of silver  
10	and i subscribed the evidence  and sealed  it   and took witnesses  and weighed  him  the money in the balances  
11	so i took the evidence of the purchase   both  that which was sealed  according  to the law and custom  and that which was open  
12	and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah  the son of maaseiah  in the sight of hanameel mine uncle s  son   and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase  before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison  
13	and i charged baruch before them  saying  
14	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  take these evidences  this evidence of the purchase  both which is sealed  and this evidence which is open  and put them in an earthen vessel  that they may continue many days  
15	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land  
16 	now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah  i prayed unto the lord  saying  
17	ah lord god  behold  thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm   and  there is nothing too hard for thee  
18	thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands  and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them  the great  the mighty god  the lord of hosts   is  his name  
19	great in counsel  and mighty in work  for thine eyes  are  open upon all the ways of the sons of men  to give every one according to his ways  and according to the fruit of his doings  
20	which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt   even  unto this day  and in israel  and among  other  men  and hast made thee a name  as at this day  
21	and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs  and with wonders  and with a strong hand  and with a stretched out arm  and with great terror  
22	and hast given them this land  which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them  a land flowing with milk and honey  
23	and they came in  and possessed it  but they obeyed not thy voice  neither walked in thy law  they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do  therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them  
24	behold the mounts  they are come unto the city to take it  and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans  that fight against it  because of the sword  and of the famine  and of the pestilence  and what thou hast spoken is come to pass  and  behold  thou seest  it   
25	and thou hast said unto me  o lord god  buy thee the field for money  and take witnesses  for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans  
26 	then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  saying  
27	behold  i  am  the lord  the god of all flesh  is there any thing too hard for me  
28	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans  and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and he shall take it  
29	and the chaldeans  that fight against this city  shall come and set fire on this city  and burn it with the houses  upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto baal  and poured out drink offerings unto other gods  to provoke me to anger  
30	for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth  for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands  saith the lord  
31	for this city hath been to me  as  a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day  that i should remove it from before my face  
32	because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah  which they have done to provoke me to anger  they  their kings  their princes  their priests  and their prophets  and the men of judah  and the inhabitants of jerusalem  
33	and they have turned unto me the back  and not the face  though i taught them  rising up early and teaching  them   yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction  
34	but they set their abominations in the house  which is called by my name  to defile it  
35	and they built the high places of baal  which  are  in the valley of the son of hinnom  to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through  the fire  unto molech  which i commanded them not  neither came it into my mind  that they should do this abomination  to cause judah to sin  
36	and now therefore thus saith the lord  the god of israel  concerning this city  whereof ye say  it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword  and by the famine  and by the pestilence  
37	behold  i will gather them out of all countries  whither i have driven them in mine anger  and in my fury  and in great wrath  and i will bring them again unto this place  and i will cause them to dwell safely  
38	and they shall be my people  and i will be their god  
39	and i will give them one heart  and one way  that they may fear me for ever  for the good of them  and of their children after them  
40	and i will make an everlasting covenant with them  that i will not turn away from them  to do them good  but i will put my fear in their hearts  that they shall not depart from me  
41	yea  i will rejoice over them to do them good  and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul  
42	for thus saith the lord  like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people  so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them  
43	and fields shall be bought in this land  whereof ye say   it is  desolate without man or beast  it is given into the hand of the chaldeans  
44	men shall buy fields for money  and subscribe evidences  and seal  them   and take witnesses in the land of benjamin  and in the places about jerusalem  and in the cities of judah  and in the cities of the mountains  and in the cities of the valley  and in the cities of the south  for i will cause their captivity to return  saith the lord  
jeremiah 33
1 	moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time  while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison  saying  
2	thus saith the lord the maker thereof  the lord that formed it  to establish it  the lord  is  his name  
3	call unto me  and i will answer thee  and shew thee great and mighty things  which thou knowest not  
4	for thus saith the lord  the god of israel  concerning the houses of this city  and concerning the houses of the kings of judah  which are thrown down by the mounts  and by the sword  
5	they come to fight with the chaldeans  but  it is  to fill them with the dead bodies of men  whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury  and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city  
6	behold  i will bring it health and cure  and i will cure them  and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth  
7	and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return  and will build them  as at the first  
8	and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity  whereby they have sinned against me  and i will pardon all their iniquities  whereby they have sinned  and whereby they have transgressed against me  
9	and it shall be to me a name of joy  a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth  which shall hear all the good that i do unto them  and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it  
10 	thus saith the lord  again there shall be heard in this place  which ye say  shall be  desolate without man and without beast   even  in the cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  that are desolate  without man  and without inhabitant  and without beast  
11	the voice of joy  and the voice of gladness  the voice of the bridegroom  and the voice of the bride  the voice of them that shall say  praise the lord of hosts  for the lord  is  good  for his mercy  endureth  for ever   and  of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord  for i will cause to return the captivity of the land  as at the first  saith the lord  
12	thus saith the lord of hosts  again in this place  which is desolate without man and without beast  and in all the cities thereof  shall be an habitation of shepherds causing  their  flocks to lie down  
13	in the cities of the mountains  in the cities of the vale  and in the cities of the south  and in the land of benjamin  and in the places about jerusalem  and in the cities of judah  shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth  them   saith the lord  
14	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah  
15	in those days  and at that time  will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david  and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land  
16	in those days shall judah be saved  and jerusalem shall dwell safely  and this  is the name  wherewith she shall be called  the lord our righteousness  
17 	for thus saith the lord  david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel  
18	neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings  and to kindle meat offerings  and to do sacrifice continually  
19	and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  saying  
20	thus saith the lord  if ye can break my covenant of the day  and my covenant of the night  and that there should not be day and night in their season  
21	 then  may also my covenant be broken with david my servant  that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne  and with the levites the priests  my ministers  
22	as the host of heaven cannot be numbered  neither the sand of the sea measured  so will i multiply the seed of david my servant  and the levites that minister unto me  
23	moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah  saying  
24	considerest thou not what this people have spoken  saying  the two families which the lord hath chosen  he hath even cast them off  thus they have despised my people  that they should be no more a nation before them  
25	thus saith the lord  if my covenant  be  not with day and night   and if  i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth  
26	then will i cast away the seed of jacob  and david my servant   so  that i will not take  any  of his seed  to be  rulers over the seed of abraham  isaac  and jacob  for i will cause their captivity to return  and have mercy on them  
jeremiah 34
1 	the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord  when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and all his army  and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion  and all the people  fought against jerusalem  and against all the cities thereof  saying  
2	thus saith the lord  the god of israel  go and speak to zedekiah king of judah  and tell him  thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall burn it with fire  
3	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand  but shalt surely be taken  and delivered into his hand  and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon  and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth  and thou shalt go to babylon  
4	yet hear the word of the lord  o zedekiah king of judah  thus saith the lord of thee  thou shalt not die by the sword  
5	 but  thou shalt die in peace  and with the burnings of thy fathers  the former kings which were before thee  so shall they burn  odours  for thee  and they will lament thee   saying   ah lord  for i have pronounced the word  saith the lord  
6	then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem  
7	when the king of babylon s army fought against jerusalem  and against all the cities of judah that were left  against lachish  and against azekah  for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah  
8 	 this is  the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord  after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which  were  at jerusalem  to proclaim liberty unto them  
9	that every man should let his manservant  and every man his maidservant   being  an hebrew or an hebrewess  go free  that none should serve himself of them   to wit   of a jew his brother  
10	now when all the princes  and all the people  which had entered into the covenant  heard that every one should let his manservant  and every one his maidservant  go free  that none should serve themselves of them any more  then they obeyed  and let  them  go  
11	but afterward they turned  and caused the servants and the handmaids  whom they had let go free  to return  and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids  
12	therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord  saying  
13	thus saith the lord  the god of israel  i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt  out of the house of bondmen  saying  
14	at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew  which hath been sold unto thee  and when he hath served thee six years  thou shalt let him go free from thee  but your fathers hearkened not unto me  neither inclined their ear  
15	and ye were now turned  and had done right in my sight  in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour  and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name  
16	but ye turned and polluted my name  and caused every man his servant  and every man his handmaid  whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure  to return  and brought them into subjection  to be unto you for servants and for handmaids  
17	therefore thus saith the lord  ye have not hearkened unto me  in proclaiming liberty  every one to his brother  and every man to his neighbour  behold  i proclaim a liberty for you  saith the lord  to the sword  to the pestilence  and to the famine  and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth  
18	and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant  which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me  when they cut the calf in twain  and passed between the parts thereof  
19	the princes of judah  and the princes of jerusalem  the eunuchs  and the priests  and all the people of the land  which passed between the parts of the calf  
20	i will even give them into the hand of their enemies  and into the hand of them that seek their life  and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven  and to the beasts of the earth  
21	and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies  and into the hand of them that seek their life  and into the hand of the king of babylon s army  which are gone up from you  
22	behold  i will command  saith the lord  and cause them to return to this city  and they shall fight against it  and take it  and burn it with fire  and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant  
jeremiah 35
1 	the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  saying  
2	go unto the house of the rechabites  and speak unto them  and bring them into the house of the lord  into one of the chambers  and give them wine to drink  
3	then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah  the son of habaziniah  and his brethren  and all his sons  and the whole house of the rechabites  
4	and i brought them into the house of the lord  into the chamber of the sons of hanan  the son of igdaliah  a man of god  which  was  by the chamber of the princes  which  was  above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum  the keeper of the door  
5	and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine  and cups  and i said unto them  drink ye wine  
6	but they said  we will drink no wine  for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us  saying  ye shall drink no wine   neither ye   nor your sons for ever  
7	neither shall ye build house  nor sow seed  nor plant vineyard  nor have  any   but all your days ye shall dwell in tents  that ye may live many days in the land where ye  be  strangers  
8	thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us  to drink no wine all our days  we  our wives  our sons  nor our daughters  
9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in  neither have we vineyard  nor field  nor seed  
10	but we have dwelt in tents  and have obeyed  and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us  
11	but it came to pass  when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land  that we said  come  and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans  and for fear of the army of the syrians  so we dwell at jerusalem  
12 	then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  saying  
13	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem  will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words  saith the lord  
14	the words of jonadab the son of rechab  that he commanded his sons not to drink wine  are performed  for unto this day they drink none  but obey their father s commandment  notwithstanding i have spoken unto you  rising early and speaking  but ye hearkened not unto me  
15	i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets  rising up early and sending  them   saying  return ye now every man from his evil way  and amend your doings  and go not after other gods to serve them  and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers  but ye have not inclined your ear  nor hearkened unto me  
16	because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father  which he commanded them  but this people hath not hearkened unto me  
17	therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them  because i have spoken unto them  but they have not heard  and i have called unto them  but they have not answered  
18	and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father  and kept all his precepts  and done according unto all that he hath commanded you  
19	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever  
jeremiah 36
1 	and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah   that  this word came unto jeremiah from the lord  saying  
2	take thee a roll of a book  and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel  and against judah  and against all the nations  from the day i spake unto thee  from the days of josiah  even unto this day  
3	it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them  that they may return every man from his evil way  that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin  
4	then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah  and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord  which he had spoken unto him  upon a roll of a book  
5	and jeremiah commanded baruch  saying  i  am  shut up  i cannot go into the house of the lord  
6	therefore go thou  and read in the roll  which thou hast written from my mouth  the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lord s house upon the fasting day  and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities  
7	it may be they will present their supplication before the lord  and will return every one from his evil way  for great  is  the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people  
8	and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him  reading in the book the words of the lord in the lord s house  
9 	and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  in the ninth month   that  they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem  and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem  
10	then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord  in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe  in the higher court  at the entry of the new gate of the lord s house  in the ears of all the people  
11	when michaiah the son of gemariah  the son of shaphan  had heard out of the book all the words of the lord  
12	then he went down into the king s house  into the scribe s chamber  and  lo  all the princes sat there   even  elishama the scribe  and delaiah the son of shemaiah  and elnathan the son of achbor  and gemariah the son of shaphan  and zedekiah the son of hananiah  and all the princes  
13	then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard  when baruch read the book in the ears of the people  
14	therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah  the son of shelemiah  the son of cushi  unto baruch  saying  take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people  and come  so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand  and came unto them  
15	and they said unto him  sit down now  and read it in our ears  so baruch read  it  in their ears  
16	now it came to pass  when they had heard all the words  they were afraid both one and other  and said unto baruch  we will surely tell the king of all these words  
17	and they asked baruch  saying  tell us now  how didst thou write all these words at his mouth  
18	then baruch answered them  he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth  and i wrote  them  with ink in the book  
19	then said the princes unto baruch  go  hide thee  thou and jeremiah  and let no man know where ye be  
20 	and they went in to the king into the court  but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe  and told all the words in the ears of the king  
21	so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll  and he took it out of elishama the scribe s chamber  and jehudi read it in the ears of the king  and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king  
22	now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month  and  there was a fire  on the hearth burning before him  
23	and it came to pass   that  when jehudi had read three or four leaves  he cut it with the penknife  and cast  it  into the fire that  was  on the hearth  until all the roll was consumed in the fire that  was  on the hearth  
24	yet they were not afraid  nor rent their garments   neither  the king  nor any of his servants that heard all these words  
25	nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll  but he would not hear them  
26	but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech  and seraiah the son of azriel  and shelemiah the son of abdeel  to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet  but the lord hid them  
27	then the word of the lord came to jeremiah  after that the king had burned the roll  and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah  saying  
28	take thee again another roll  and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll  which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned  
29	and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah  thus saith the lord  thou hast burned this roll  saying  why hast thou written therein  saying  the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land  and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast  
30	therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah  he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david  and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat  and in the night to the frost  
31	and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity  and i will bring upon them  and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem  and upon the men of judah  all the evil that i have pronounced against them  but they hearkened not  
32	then took jeremiah another roll  and gave it to baruch the scribe  the son of neriah  who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire  and there were added besides unto them many like words  
jeremiah 37
1 	and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim  whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah  
2	but neither he  nor his servants  nor the people of the land  did hearken unto the words of the lord  which he spake by the prophet jeremiah  
3	and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah  saying  pray now unto the lord our god for us  
4	now jeremiah came in and went out among the people  for they had not put him into prison  
5	then pharaoh s army was come forth out of egypt  and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them  they departed from jerusalem  
6	then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah  saying  
7	thus saith the lord  the god of israel  thus shall ye say to the king of judah  that sent you unto me to enquire of me  behold  pharaoh s army  which is come forth to help you  shall return to egypt into their own land  
8	and the chaldeans shall come again  and fight against this city  and take it  and burn it with fire  
9	thus saith the lord  deceive not yourselves  saying  the chaldeans shall surely depart from us  for they shall not depart  
10	for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you  and there remained  but  wounded men among them   yet  should they rise up every man in his tent  and burn this city with fire  
11 	and it came to pass  that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh s army  
12	then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin  to separate himself thence in the midst of the people  
13	and when he was in the gate of benjamin  a captain of the ward  was  there  whose name  was  irijah  the son of shelemiah  the son of hananiah  and he took jeremiah the prophet  saying  thou fallest away to the chaldeans  
14	then said jeremiah   it is  false  i fall not away to the chaldeans  but he hearkened not to him  so irijah took jeremiah  and brought him to the princes  
15	wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah  and smote him  and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe  for they had made that the prison  
16	when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon  and into the cabins  and jeremiah had remained there many days  
17	then zedekiah the king sent  and took him out  and the king asked him secretly in his house  and said  is there  any  word from the lord  and jeremiah said  there is  for  said he  thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon  
18	moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah  what have i offended against thee  or against thy servants  or against this people  that ye have put me in prison  
19	where  are  now your prophets which prophesied unto you  saying  the king of babylon shall not come against you  nor against this land  
20	therefore hear now  i pray thee  o my lord the king  let my supplication  i pray thee  be accepted before thee  that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe  lest i die there  
21	then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison  and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers  street  until all the bread in the city were spent  thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison  
jeremiah 38
1 	then shephatiah the son of mattan  and gedaliah the son of pashur  and jucal the son of shelemiah  and pashur the son of malchiah  heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people  saying  
2	thus saith the lord  he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live  for he shall have his life for a prey  and shall live  
3	thus saith the lord  this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon s army  which shall take it  
4	therefore the princes said unto the king  we beseech thee  let this man be put to death  for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city  and the hands of all the people  in speaking such words unto them  for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people  but the hurt  
5	then zedekiah the king said  behold  he  is  in your hand  for the king  is  not  he that  can do  any  thing against you  
6	then took they jeremiah  and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech  that  was  in the court of the prison  and they let down jeremiah with cords  and in the dungeon  there was  no water  but mire  so jeremiah sunk in the mire  
7	now when ebedmelech the ethiopian  one of the eunuchs which was in the king s house  heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon  the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin  
8	ebedmelech went forth out of the king s house  and spake to the king  saying  
9	my lord the king  these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet  whom they have cast into the dungeon  and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is  for  there is  no more bread in the city  
10	then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian  saying  take from hence thirty men with thee  and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon  before he die  
11	so ebedmelech took the men with him  and went into the house of the king under the treasury  and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags  and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah  
12	and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah  put now  these  old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords  and jeremiah did so  
13	so they drew up jeremiah with cords  and took him up out of the dungeon  and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison  
14 	then zedekiah the king sent  and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that  is  in the house of the lord  and the king said unto jeremiah  i will ask thee a thing  hide nothing from me  
15	then jeremiah said unto zedekiah  if i declare  it  unto thee  wilt thou not surely put me to death  and if i give thee counsel  wilt thou not hearken unto me  
16	so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah  saying   as  the lord liveth  that made us this soul  i will not put thee to death  neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life  
17	then said jeremiah unto zedekiah  thus saith the lord  the god of hosts  the god of israel  if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon s princes  then thy soul shall live  and this city shall not be burned with fire  and thou shalt live  and thine house  
18	but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon s princes  then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans  and they shall burn it with fire  and thou shalt not escape out of their hand  
19	and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah  i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans  lest they deliver me into their hand  and they mock me  
20	but jeremiah said  they shall not deliver  thee   obey  i beseech thee  the voice of the lord  which i speak unto thee  so it shall be well unto thee  and thy soul shall live  
21	but if thou refuse to go forth  this  is  the word that the lord hath shewed me  
22	and  behold  all the women that are left in the king of judah s house  shall be  brought forth to the king of babylon s princes  and those  women  shall say  thy friends have set thee on  and have prevailed against thee  thy feet are sunk in the mire   and  they are turned away back  
23	so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans  and thou shalt not escape out of their hand  but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon  and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire  
24	then said zedekiah unto jeremiah  let no man know of these words  and thou shalt not die  
25	but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee  and they come unto thee  and say unto thee  declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king  hide it not from us  and we will not put thee to death  also what the king said unto thee  
26	then thou shalt say unto them  i presented my supplication before the king  that he would not cause me to return to jonathan s house  to die there  
27	then came all the princes unto jeremiah  and asked him  and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded  so they left off speaking with him  for the matter was not perceived  
28	so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken  and he was  there  when jerusalem was taken  
jeremiah 39
1 	in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah  in the tenth month  came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem  and they besieged it  
2	 and  in the eleventh year of zedekiah  in the fourth month  the ninth  day  of the month  the city was broken up  
3	and all the princes of the king of babylon came in  and sat in the middle gate   even  nergalsharezer  samgarnebo  sarsechim  rabsaris  nergalsharezer  rabmag  with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon  
4	and it came to pass   that  when zedekiah the king of judah saw them  and all the men of war  then they fled  and went forth out of the city by night  by the way of the king s garden  by the gate betwixt the two walls  and he went out the way of the plain  
5	but the chaldeans  army pursued after them  and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho  and when they had taken him  they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath  where he gave judgment upon him  
6	then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes  also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah  
7	moreover he put out zedekiah s eyes  and bound him with chains  to carry him to babylon  
8	and the chaldeans burned the king s house  and the houses of the people  with fire  and brake down the walls of jerusalem  
9	then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city  and those that fell away  that fell to him  with the rest of the people that remained  
10	but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people  which had nothing  in the land of judah  and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time  
11 	now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard  saying  
12	take him  and look well to him  and do him no harm  but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee  
13	so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent  and nebushasban  rabsaris  and nergalsharezer  rabmag  and all the king of babylon s princes  
14	even they sent  and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison  and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  that he should carry him home  so he dwelt among the people  
15	now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  while he was shut up in the court of the prison  saying  
16	go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will bring my words upon this city for evil  and not for good  and they shall be  accomplished  in that day before thee  
17	but i will deliver thee in that day  saith the lord  and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou  art  afraid  
18	for i will surely deliver thee  and thou shalt not fall by the sword  but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee  because thou hast put thy trust in me  saith the lord  
jeremiah 40
1 	the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah  when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah  which were carried away captive unto babylon  
2	and the captain of the guard took jeremiah  and said unto him  the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place  
3	now the lord hath brought  it   and done according as he hath said  because ye have sinned against the lord  and have not obeyed his voice  therefore this thing is come upon you  
4	and now  behold  i loose thee this day from the chains which  were  upon thine hand  if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon  come  and i will look well unto thee  but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon  forbear  behold  all the land  is  before thee  whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go  thither go  
5	now while he was not yet gone back   he said   go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah  and dwell with him among the people  or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go  so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward  and let him go  
6	then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah  and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land  
7 	now when all the captains of the forces which  were  in the fields   even  they and their men  heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land  and had committed unto him men  and women  and children  and of the poor of the land  of them that were not carried away captive to babylon  
8	then they came to gedaliah to mizpah  even ishmael the son of nethaniah  and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah  and seraiah the son of tanhumeth  and the sons of ephai the netophathite  and jezaniah the son of a maachathite  they and their men  
9	and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men  saying  fear not to serve the chaldeans  dwell in the land  and serve the king of babylon  and it shall be well with you  
10	as for me  behold  i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans  which will come unto us  but ye  gather ye wine  and summer fruits  and oil  and put  them  in your vessels  and dwell in your cities that ye have taken  
11	likewise when all the jews that  were  in moab  and among the ammonites  and in edom  and that  were  in all the countries  heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah  and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  
12	even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven  and came to the land of judah  to gedaliah  unto mizpah  and gathered wine and summer fruits very much  
13	moreover johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces that  were  in the fields  came to gedaliah to mizpah  
14	and said unto him  dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee  but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not  
15	then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly  saying  let me go  i pray thee  and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah  and no man shall know  it   wherefore should he slay thee  that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered  and the remnant in judah perish  
16	but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah  thou shalt not do this thing  for thou speakest falsely of ishmael  
jeremiah 41
1 	now it came to pass in the seventh month   that  ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama  of the seed royal  and the princes of the king  even ten men with him  came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah  and there they did eat bread together in mizpah  
2	then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah  and the ten men that were with him  and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword  and slew him  whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land  
3	ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him   even  with gedaliah  at mizpah  and the chaldeans that were found there   and  the men of war  
4	and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah  and no man knew  it   
5	that there came certain from shechem  from shiloh  and from samaria   even  fourscore men  having their beards shaven  and their clothes rent  and having cut themselves  with offerings and incense in their hand  to bring  them  to the house of the lord  
6	and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them  weeping all along as he went  and it came to pass  as he met them  he said unto them  come to gedaliah the son of ahikam  
7	and it was  so   when they came into the midst of the city  that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them   and cast them  into the midst of the pit  he  and the men that  were  with him  
8	but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael  slay us not  for we have treasures in the field  of wheat  and of barley  and of oil  and of honey  so he forbare  and slew them not among their brethren  
9	now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men  whom he had slain because of gedaliah   was  it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel   and  ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with  them that were  slain  
10	then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that  were  in mizpah   even  the king s daughters  and all the people that remained in mizpah  whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam  and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive  and departed to go over to the ammonites  
11 	but when johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him  heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done  
12	then they took all the men  and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah  and found him by the great waters that  are  in gibeon  
13	now it came to pass   that  when all the people which  were  with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him  then they were glad  
14	so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned  and went unto johanan the son of kareah  
15	but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men  and went to the ammonites  
16	then took johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him  all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah  from mizpah  after  that  he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam   even  mighty men of war  and the women  and the children  and the eunuchs  whom he had brought again from gibeon  
17	and they departed  and dwelt in the habitation of chimham  which is by bethlehem  to go to enter into egypt  
18	because of the chaldeans  for they were afraid of them  because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam  whom the king of babylon made governor in the land  
jeremiah 42
1 	then all the captains of the forces  and johanan the son of kareah  and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah  and all the people from the least even unto the greatest  came near  
2	and said unto jeremiah the prophet  let  we beseech thee  our supplication be accepted before thee  and pray for us unto the lord thy god   even  for all this remnant   for we are left  but  a few of many  as thine eyes do behold us   
3	that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk  and the thing that we may do  
4	then jeremiah the prophet said unto them  i have heard  you   behold  i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words  and it shall come to pass   that  whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you  i will declare  it  unto you  i will keep nothing back from you  
5	then they said to jeremiah  the lord be a true and faithful witness between us  if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us  
6	whether  it be  good  or whether  it be  evil  we will obey the voice of the lord our god  to whom we send thee  that it may be well with us  when we obey the voice of the lord our god  
7 	and it came to pass after ten days  that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  
8	then called he johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces which  were  with him  and all the people from the least even to the greatest  
9	and said unto them  thus saith the lord  the god of israel  unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him  
10	if ye will still abide in this land  then will i build you  and not pull  you  down  and i will plant you  and not pluck  you  up  for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you  
11	be not afraid of the king of babylon  of whom ye are afraid  be not afraid of him  saith the lord  for i  am  with you to save you  and to deliver you from his hand  
12	and i will shew mercies unto you  that he may have mercy upon you  and cause you to return to your own land  
13	but if ye say  we will not dwell in this land  neither obey the voice of the lord your god  
14	saying  no  but we will go into the land of egypt  where we shall see no war  nor hear the sound of the trumpet  nor have hunger of bread  and there will we dwell  
15	and now therefore hear the word of the lord  ye remnant of judah  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt  and go to sojourn there  
16	then it shall come to pass   that  the sword  which ye feared  shall overtake you there in the land of egypt  and the famine  whereof ye were afraid  shall follow close after you there in egypt  and there ye shall die  
17	so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there  they shall die by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them  
18	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem  so shall my fury be poured forth upon you  when ye shall enter into egypt  and ye shall be an execration  and an astonishment  and a curse  and a reproach  and ye shall see this place no more  
19	the lord hath said concerning you  o ye remnant of judah  go ye not into egypt  know certainly that i have admonished you this day  
20	for ye dissembled in your hearts  when ye sent me unto the lord your god  saying  pray for us unto the lord our god  and according unto all that the lord our god shall say  so declare unto us  and we will do  it   
21	and  now  i have this day declared  it  to you  but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god  nor any  thing  for the which he hath sent me unto you  
22	now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  in the place whither ye desire to go  and  to sojourn  
jeremiah 43
1 	and it came to pass   that  when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god  for which the lord their god had sent him to them   even  all these words  
2	then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah  and johanan the son of kareah  and all the proud men  saying unto jeremiah  thou speakest falsely  the lord our god hath not sent thee to say  go not into egypt to sojourn there  
3	but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us  for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans  that they might put us to death  and carry us away captives into babylon  
4	so johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces  and all the people  obeyed not the voice of the lord  to dwell in the land of judah  
5	but johanan the son of kareah  and all the captains of the forces  took all the remnant of judah  that were returned from all nations  whither they had been driven  to dwell in the land of judah  
6	 even  men  and women  and children  and the king s daughters  and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  and jeremiah the prophet  and baruch the son of neriah  
7	so they came into the land of egypt  for they obeyed not the voice of the lord  thus came they  even  to tahpanhes  
8 	then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes  saying  
9	take great stones in thine hand  and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln  which  is  at the entry of pharaoh s house in tahpanhes  in the sight of the men of judah  
10	and say unto them  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid  and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them  
11	and when he cometh  he shall smite the land of egypt   and deliver  such  as are  for death to death  and such  as are  for captivity to captivity  and such  as are  for the sword to the sword  
12	and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt  and he shall burn them  and carry them away captives  and he shall array himself with the land of egypt  as a shepherd putteth on his garment  and he shall go forth from thence in peace  
13	he shall break also the images of bethshemesh  that  is  in the land of egypt  and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire  
jeremiah 44
1 	the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt  which dwell at migdol  and at tahpanhes  and at noph  and in the country of pathros  saying  
2	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem  and upon all the cities of judah  and  behold  this day they  are  a desolation  and no man dwelleth therein  
3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger  in that they went to burn incense   and  to serve other gods  whom they knew not   neither  they  ye  nor your fathers  
4	howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets  rising early and sending  them   saying  oh  do not this abominable thing that i hate  
5	but they hearkened not  nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness  to burn no incense unto other gods  
6	wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth  and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem  and they are wasted  and  desolate  as at this day  
7	therefore now thus saith the lord  the god of hosts  the god of israel  wherefore commit ye  this  great evil against your souls  to cut off from you man and woman  child and suckling  out of judah  to leave you none to remain  
8	in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands  burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt  whither ye be gone to dwell  that ye might cut yourselves off  and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth  
9	have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers  and the wickedness of the kings of judah  and the wickedness of their wives  and your own wickedness  and the wickedness of your wives  which they have committed in the land of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  
10	they are not humbled  even  unto this day  neither have they feared  nor walked in my law  nor in my statutes  that i set before you and before your fathers  
11	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will set my face against you for evil  and to cut off all judah  
12	and i will take the remnant of judah  that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there  and they shall all be consumed   and  fall in the land of egypt  they shall  even  be consumed by the sword  and  by the famine  they shall die  from the least even unto the greatest  by the sword and by the famine  and they shall be an execration   and  an astonishment  and a curse  and a reproach  
13	for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt  as i have punished jerusalem  by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  
14	so that none of the remnant of judah  which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there  shall escape or remain  that they should return into the land of judah  to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there  for none shall return but such as shall escape  
15 	then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods  and all the women that stood by  a great multitude  even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt  in pathros  answered jeremiah  saying  
16	 as for  the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord  we will not hearken unto thee  
17	but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth  to burn incense unto the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offerings unto her  as we have done  we  and our fathers  our kings  and our princes  in the cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  for  then  had we plenty of victuals  and were well  and saw no evil  
18	but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offerings unto her  we have wanted all  things   and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine  
19	and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven  and poured out drink offerings unto her  did we make her cakes to worship her  and pour out drink offerings unto her  without our men  
20 	then jeremiah said unto all the people  to the men  and to the women  and to all the people which had given him  that  answer  saying  
21	the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  ye  and your fathers  your kings  and your princes  and the people of the land  did not the lord remember them  and came it  not  into his mind  
22	so that the lord could no longer bear  because of the evil of your doings   and  because of the abominations which ye have committed  therefore is your land a desolation  and an astonishment  and a curse  without an inhabitant  as at this day  
23	because ye have burned incense  and because ye have sinned against the lord  and have not obeyed the voice of the lord  nor walked in his law  nor in his statutes  nor in his testimonies  therefore this evil is happened unto you  as at this day  
24	moreover jeremiah said unto all the people  and to all the women  hear the word of the lord  all judah that  are  in the land of egypt  
25	thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  saying  ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths  and fulfilled with your hand  saying  we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed  to burn incense to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offerings unto her  ye will surely accomplish your vows  and surely perform your vows  
26	therefore hear ye the word of the lord  all judah that dwell in the land of egypt  behold  i have sworn by my great name  saith the lord  that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt  saying  the lord god liveth  
27	behold  i will watch over them for evil  and not for good  and all the men of judah that  are  in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine  until there be an end of them  
28	yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah  and all the remnant of judah  that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there  shall know whose words shall stand  mine  or theirs  
29	and this  shall be  a sign unto you  saith the lord  that i will punish you in this place  that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil  
30	thus saith the lord  behold  i will give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies  and into the hand of them that seek his life  as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  his enemy  and that sought his life  
jeremiah 45
1 	the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah  when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah  in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  saying  
2	thus saith the lord  the god of israel  unto thee  o baruch  
3	thou didst say  woe is me now  for the lord hath added grief to my sorrow  i fainted in my sighing  and i find no rest  
4	thus shalt thou say unto him  the lord saith thus  behold   that  which i have built will i break down  and that which i have planted i will pluck up  even this whole land  
5	and seekest thou great things for thyself  seek  them  not  for  behold  i will bring evil upon all flesh  saith the lord  but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest  
jeremiah 46
1 	the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles  
2	against egypt  against the army of pharaohnecho king of egypt  which was by the river euphrates in carchemish  which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  
3	order ye the buckler and shield  and draw near to battle  
4	harness the horses  and get up  ye horsemen  and stand forth with  your  helmets  furbish the spears   and  put on the brigandines  
5	wherefore have i seen them dismayed  and  turned away back  and their mighty ones are beaten down  and are fled apace  and look not back   for  fear  was  round about  saith the lord  
6	let not the swift flee away  nor the mighty man escape  they shall stumble  and fall toward the north by the river euphrates  
7	who  is  this  that  cometh up as a flood  whose waters are moved as the rivers  
8	egypt riseth up like a flood  and  his  waters are moved like the rivers  and he saith  i will go up   and  will cover the earth  i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof  
9	come up  ye horses  and rage  ye chariots  and let the mighty men come forth  the ethiopians and the libyans  that handle the shield  and the lydians  that handle  and  bend the bow  
10	for this  is  the day of the lord god of hosts  a day of vengeance  that he may avenge him of his adversaries  and the sword shall devour  and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood  for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates  
11	go up into gilead  and take balm  o virgin  the daughter of egypt  in vain shalt thou use many medicines   for  thou shalt not be cured  
12 	the nations have heard of thy shame  and thy cry hath filled the land  for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty   and  they are fallen both together  
13	the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet  how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come  and  smite the land of egypt  
14	declare ye in egypt  and publish in migdol  and publish in noph and in tahpanhes  say ye  stand fast  and prepare thee  for the sword shall devour round about thee  
15	why are thy valiant  men  swept away  they stood not  because the lord did drive them  
16	he made many to fall  yea  one fell upon another  and they said  arise  and let us go again to our own people  and to the land of our nativity  from the oppressing sword  
17	they did cry there  pharaoh king of egypt  is but  a noise  he hath passed the time appointed  
18	 as  i live  saith the king  whose name  is  the lord of hosts  surely as tabor  is  among the mountains  and as carmel by the sea   so  shall he come  
19	o thou daughter dwelling in egypt  furnish thyself to go into captivity  for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant  
20	egypt  is like  a very fair heifer   but  destruction cometh  it cometh out of the north  
21	also her hired men  are  in the midst of her like fatted bullocks  for they also are turned back   and  are fled away together  they did not stand  because the day of their calamity was come upon them   and  the time of their visitation  
22	the voice thereof shall go like a serpent  for they shall march with an army  and come against her with axes  as hewers of wood  
23	they shall cut down her forest  saith the lord  though it cannot be searched  because they are more than the grasshoppers  and  are  innumerable  
24	the daughter of egypt shall be confounded  she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north  
25	the lord of hosts  the god of israel  saith  behold  i will punish the multitude of no  and pharaoh  and egypt  with their gods  and their kings  even pharaoh  and  all  them that trust in him  
26	and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives  and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and into the hand of his servants  and afterward it shall be inhabited  as in the days of old  saith the lord  
27	but fear not thou  o my servant jacob  and be not dismayed  o israel  for  behold  i will save thee from afar off  and thy seed from the land of their captivity  and jacob shall return  and be in rest and at ease  and none shall make  him  afraid  
28	fear thou not  o jacob my servant  saith the lord  for i  am  with thee  for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee  but i will not make a full end of thee  but correct thee in measure  yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished  
jeremiah 47
1 	the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines  before that pharaoh smote gaza  
2	thus saith the lord  behold  waters rise up out of the north  and shall be an overflowing flood  and shall overflow the land  and all that is therein  the city  and them that dwell therein  then the men shall cry  and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl  
3	at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong  horses   at the rushing of his chariots   and at  the rumbling of his wheels  the fathers shall not look back to  their  children for feebleness of hands  
4	because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines   and  to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth  for the lord will spoil the philistines  the remnant of the country of caphtor  
5	baldness is come upon gaza  ashkelon is cut off  with  the remnant of their valley  how long wilt thou cut thyself  
6	o thou sword of the lord  how long  will it be  ere thou be quiet  put up thyself into thy scabbard  rest  and be still  
7	how can it be quiet  seeing the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon  and against the sea shore  there hath he appointed it  
jeremiah 48
1 	against moab thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  woe unto nebo  for it is spoiled  kiriathaim is confounded  and  taken  misgab is confounded and dismayed  
2	 there shall be  no more praise of moab  in heshbon they have devised evil against it  come  and let us cut it off from  being  a nation  also thou shalt be cut down  o madmen  the sword shall pursue thee  
3	a voice of crying  shall be  from horonaim  spoiling and great destruction  
4	moab is destroyed  her little ones have caused a cry to be heard  
5	for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up  for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction  
6	flee  save your lives  and be like the heath in the wilderness  
7	for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures  thou shalt also be taken  and chemosh shall go forth into captivity  with  his priests and his princes together  
8	and the spoiler shall come upon every city  and no city shall escape  the valley also shall perish  and the plain shall be destroyed  as the lord hath spoken  
9	give wings unto moab  that it may flee and get away  for the cities thereof shall be desolate  without any to dwell therein  
10	cursed  be  he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully  and cursed  be  he that keepeth back his sword from blood  
11	moab hath been at ease from his youth  and he hath settled on his lees  and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel  neither hath he gone into captivity  therefore his taste remained in him  and his scent is not changed  
12	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will send unto him wanderers  that shall cause him to wander  and shall empty his vessels  and break their bottles  
13	and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh  as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence  
14 	how say ye  we  are  mighty and strong men for the war  
15	moab is spoiled  and gone up  out of  her cities  and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter  saith the king  whose name  is  the lord of hosts  
16	the calamity of moab  is  near to come  and his affliction hasteth fast  
17	all ye that are about him  bemoan him  and all ye that know his name  say  how is the strong staff broken   and  the beautiful rod  
18	thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon  come down from  thy  glory  and sit in thirst  for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee   and  he shall destroy thy strong holds  
19	o inhabitant of aroer  stand by the way  and espy  ask him that fleeth  and her that escapeth   and  say  what is done  
20	moab is confounded  for it is broken down  howl and cry  tell ye it in arnon  that moab is spoiled  
21	and judgment is come upon the plain country  upon holon  and upon jahazah  and upon mephaath  
22	and upon dibon  and upon nebo  and upon bethdiblathaim  
23	and upon kiriathaim  and upon bethgamul  and upon bethmeon  
24	and upon kerioth  and upon bozrah  and upon all the cities of the land of moab  far or near  
25	the horn of moab is cut off  and his arm is broken  saith the lord  
26	make ye him drunken  for he magnified  himself  against the lord  moab also shall wallow in his vomit  and he also shall be in derision  
27	for was not israel a derision unto thee  was he found among thieves  for since thou spakest of him  thou skippedst for joy  
28	o ye that dwell in moab  leave the cities  and dwell in the rock  and be like the dove  that  maketh her nest in the sides of the hole s mouth  
29	we have heard the pride of moab   he is exceeding proud  his loftiness  and his arrogancy  and his pride  and the haughtiness of his heart  
30	i know his wrath  saith the lord  but  it shall  not  be  so  his lies shall not so effect  it   
31	therefore will i howl for moab  and i will cry out for all moab   mine heart  shall mourn for the men of kirheres  
32	o vine of sibmah  i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer  thy plants are gone over the sea  they reach  even  to the sea of jazer  the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage  
33	and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field  and from the land of moab  and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses  none shall tread with shouting   their  shouting  shall be  no shouting  
34	from the cry of heshbon  even  unto elealeh   and even  unto jahaz  have they uttered their voice  from zoar  even  unto horonaim   as  an heifer of three years old  for the waters also of nimrim shall be desolate  
35	moreover i will cause to cease in moab  saith the lord  him that offereth in the high places  and him that burneth incense to his gods  
36	therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes  and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres  because the riches  that  he hath gotten are perished  
37	for every head  shall be  bald  and every beard clipped  upon all the hands  shall be  cuttings  and upon the loins sackcloth  
38	 there shall be  lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab  and in the streets thereof  for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure  saith the lord  
39	they shall howl   saying   how is it broken down  how hath moab turned the back with shame  so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him  
40	for thus saith the lord  behold  he shall fly as an eagle  and shall spread his wings over moab  
41	kerioth is taken  and the strong holds are surprised  and the mighty men s hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs  
42	and moab shall be destroyed from  being  a people  because he hath magnified  himself  against the lord  
43	fear  and the pit  and the snare   shall be  upon thee  o inhabitant of moab  saith the lord  
44	he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit  and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare  for i will bring upon it   even  upon moab  the year of their visitation  saith the lord  
45	they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force  but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon  and a flame from the midst of sihon  and shall devour the corner of moab  and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones  
46	woe be unto thee  o moab  the people of chemosh perisheth  for thy sons are taken captives  and thy daughters captives  
47	yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days  saith the lord  thus far  is  the judgment of moab  
jeremiah 49
1 	concerning the ammonites  thus saith the lord  hath israel no sons  hath he no heir  why  then  doth their king inherit gad  and his people dwell in his cities  
2	therefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard in rabbah of the ammonites  and it shall be a desolate heap  and her daughters shall be burned with fire  then shall israel be heir unto them that were his heirs  saith the lord  
3	howl  o heshbon  for ai is spoiled  cry  ye daughters of rabbah  gird you with sackcloth  lament  and run to and fro by the hedges  for their king shall go into captivity   and  his priests and his princes together  
4	wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys  thy flowing valley  o backsliding daughter  that trusted in her treasures   saying   who shall come unto me  
5	behold  i will bring a fear upon thee  saith the lord god of hosts  from all those that be about thee  and ye shall be driven out every man right forth  and none shall gather up him that wandereth  
6	and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of ammon  saith the lord  
7 	concerning edom  thus saith the lord of hosts   is  wisdom no more in teman  is counsel perished from the prudent  is their wisdom vanished  
8	flee ye  turn back  dwell deep  o inhabitants of dedan  for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him  the time  that  i will visit him  
9	if grapegatherers come to thee  would they not leave  some  gleaning grapes  if thieves by night  they will destroy till they have enough  
10	but i have made esau bare  i have uncovered his secret places  and he shall not be able to hide himself  his seed is spoiled  and his brethren  and his neighbours  and he  is  not  
11	leave thy fatherless children  i will preserve  them  alive  and let thy widows trust in me  
12	for thus saith the lord  behold  they whose judgment  was  not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken  and  art  thou he  that  shall altogether go unpunished  thou shalt not go unpunished  but thou shalt surely drink  of it   
13	for i have sworn by myself  saith the lord  that bozrah shall become a desolation  a reproach  a waste  and a curse  and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes  
14	i have heard a rumour from the lord  and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen   saying   gather ye together  and come against her  and rise up to the battle  
15	for  lo  i will make thee small among the heathen   and  despised among men  
16	thy terribleness hath deceived thee   and  the pride of thine heart  o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock  that holdest the height of the hill  though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle  i will bring thee down from thence  saith the lord  
17	also edom shall be a desolation  every one that goeth by it shall be astonished  and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof  
18	as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour  cities  thereof  saith the lord  no man shall abide there  neither shall a son of man dwell in it  
19	behold  he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong  but i will suddenly make him run away from her  and who  is  a chosen  man  that  i may appoint over her  for who  is  like me  and who will appoint me the time  and who  is  that shepherd that will stand before me  
20	therefore hear the counsel of the lord  that he hath taken against edom  and his purposes  that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman  surely the least of the flock shall draw them out  surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them  
21	the earth is moved at the noise of their fall  at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea  
22	behold  he shall come up and fly as the eagle  and spread his wings over bozrah  and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs  
23 	concerning damascus  hamath is confounded  and arpad  for they have heard evil tidings  they are fainthearted   there is  sorrow on the sea  it cannot be quiet  
24	damascus is waxed feeble   and  turneth herself to flee  and fear hath seized on  her   anguish and sorrows have taken her  as a woman in travail  
25	how is the city of praise not left  the city of my joy  
26	therefore her young men shall fall in her streets  and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day  saith the lord of hosts  
27	and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus  and it shall consume the palaces of benhadad  
28 	concerning kedar  and concerning the kingdoms of hazor  which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite  thus saith the lord  arise ye  go up to kedar  and spoil the men of the east  
29	their tents and their flocks shall they take away  they shall take to themselves their curtains  and all their vessels  and their camels  and they shall cry unto them  fear  is  on every side  
30	flee  get you far off  dwell deep  o ye inhabitants of hazor  saith the lord  for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you  and hath conceived a purpose against you  
31	arise  get you up unto the wealthy nation  that dwelleth without care  saith the lord  which have neither gates nor bars   which  dwell alone  
32	and their camels shall be a booty  and the multitude of their cattle a spoil  and i will scatter into all winds them  that are  in the utmost corners  and i will bring their calamity from all sides thereof  saith the lord  
33	and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons   and  a desolation for ever  there shall no man abide there  nor  any  son of man dwell in it  
34 	the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah  saying  
35	thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  i will break the bow of elam  the chief of their might  
36	and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven  and will scatter them toward all those winds  and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come  
37	for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies  and before them that seek their life  and i will bring evil upon them   even  my fierce anger  saith the lord  and i will send the sword after them  till i have consumed them  
38	and i will set my throne in elam  and will destroy from thence the king and the princes  saith the lord  
39	but it shall come to pass in the latter days   that  i will bring again the captivity of elam  saith the lord  
jeremiah 50
1 	the word that the lord spake against babylon  and  against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet  
2	declare ye among the nations  and publish  and set up a standard  publish   and  conceal not  say  babylon is taken  bel is confounded  merodach is broken in pieces  her idols are confounded  her images are broken in pieces  
3	for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her  which shall make her land desolate  and none shall dwell therein  they shall remove  they shall depart  both man and beast  
4	in those days  and in that time  saith the lord  the children of israel shall come  they and the children of judah together  going and weeping  they shall go  and seek the lord their god  
5	they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward   saying   come  and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant  that  shall not be forgotten  
6	my people hath been lost sheep  their shepherds have caused them to go astray  they have turned them away  on  the mountains  they have gone from mountain to hill  they have forgotten their restingplace  
7	all that found them have devoured them  and their adversaries said  we offend not  because they have sinned against the lord  the habitation of justice  even the lord  the hope of their fathers  
8	remove out of the midst of babylon  and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans  and be as the he goats before the flocks  
9 	for  lo  i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country  and they shall set themselves in array against her  from thence she shall be taken  their arrows  shall be  as of a mighty expert man  none shall return in vain  
10	and chaldea shall be a spoil  all that spoil her shall be satisfied  saith the lord  
11	because ye were glad  because ye rejoiced  o ye destroyers of mine heritage  because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass  and bellow as bulls  
12	your mother shall be sore confounded  she that bare you shall be ashamed  behold  the hindermost of the nations  shall be  a wilderness  a dry land  and a desert  
13	because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited  but it shall be wholly desolate  every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished  and hiss at all her plagues  
14	put yourselves in array against babylon round about  all ye that bend the bow  shoot at her  spare no arrows  for she hath sinned against the lord  
15	shout against her round about  she hath given her hand  her foundations are fallen  her walls are thrown down  for it  is  the vengeance of the lord  take vengeance upon her  as she hath done  do unto her  
16	cut off the sower from babylon  and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest  for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people  and they shall flee every one to his own land  
17	israel  is  a scattered sheep  the lions have driven  him  away  first the king of assyria hath devoured him  and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones  
18	therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will punish the king of babylon and his land  as i have punished the king of assyria  
19	and i will bring israel again to his habitation  and he shall feed on carmel and bashan  and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead  
20	in those days  and in that time  saith the lord  the iniquity of israel shall be sought for  and  there shall be  none  and the sins of judah  and they shall not be found  for i will pardon them whom i reserve  
21 	go up against the land of merathaim   even  against it  and against the inhabitants of pekod  waste and utterly destroy after them  saith the lord  and do according to all that i have commanded thee  
22	a sound of battle  is  in the land  and of great destruction  
23	how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken  how is babylon become a desolation among the nations  
24	i have laid a snare for thee  and thou art also taken  o babylon  and thou wast not aware  thou art found  and also caught  because thou hast striven against the lord  
25	the lord hath opened his armoury  and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation  for this  is  the work of the lord god of hosts in the land of the chaldeans  
26	come against her from the utmost border  open her storehouses  cast her up as heaps  and destroy her utterly  let nothing of her be left  
27	slay all her bullocks  let them go down to the slaughter  woe unto them  for their day is come  the time of their visitation  
28	the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon  to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god  the vengeance of his temple  
29	call together the archers against babylon  all ye that bend the bow  camp against it round about  let none thereof escape  recompense her according to her work  according to all that she hath done  do unto her  for she hath been proud against the lord  against the holy one of israel  
30	therefore shall her young men fall in the streets  and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day  saith the lord  
31	behold  i  am  against thee   o thou  most proud  saith the lord god of hosts  for thy day is come  the time  that  i will visit thee  
32	and the most proud shall stumble and fall  and none shall raise him up  and i will kindle a fire in his cities  and it shall devour all round about him  
33 	thus saith the lord of hosts  the children of israel and the children of judah  were  oppressed together  and all that took them captives held them fast  they refused to let them go  
34	their redeemer  is  strong  the lord of hosts  is  his name  he shall throughly plead their cause  that he may give rest to the land  and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon  
35	a sword  is  upon the chaldeans  saith the lord  and upon the inhabitants of babylon  and upon her princes  and upon her wise  men   
36	a sword  is  upon the liars  and they shall dote  a sword  is  upon her mighty men  and they shall be dismayed  
37	a sword  is  upon their horses  and upon their chariots  and upon all the mingled people that  are  in the midst of her  and they shall become as women  a sword  is  upon her treasures  and they shall be robbed  
38	a drought  is  upon her waters  and they shall be dried up  for it  is  the land of graven images  and they are mad upon  their  idols  
39	therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell  there   and the owls shall dwell therein  and it shall be no more inhabited for ever  neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation  
40	as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour  cities  thereof  saith the lord   so  shall no man abide there  neither shall any son of man dwell therein  
41	behold  a people shall come from the north  and a great nation  and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth  
42	they shall hold the bow and the lance  they  are  cruel  and will not shew mercy  their voice shall roar like the sea  and they shall ride upon horses   every one  put in array  like a man to the battle  against thee  o daughter of babylon  
43	the king of babylon hath heard the report of them  and his hands waxed feeble  anguish took hold of him   and  pangs as of a woman in travail  
44	behold  he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan unto the habitation of the strong  but i will make them suddenly run away from her  and who  is  a chosen  man  that  i may appoint over her  for who  is  like me  and who will appoint me the time  and who  is  that shepherd that will stand before me  
45	therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord  that he hath taken against babylon  and his purposes  that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans  surely the least of the flock shall draw them out  surely he shall make  their  habitation desolate with them  
46	at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved  and the cry is heard among the nations  
jeremiah 51
1 	thus saith the lord  behold  i will raise up against babylon  and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me  a destroying wind  
2	and will send unto babylon fanners  that shall fan her  and shall empty her land  for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about  
3	against  him that  bendeth let the archer bend his bow  and against  him that  lifteth himself up in his brigandine  and spare ye not her young men  destroy ye utterly all her host  
4	thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans  and  they that are  thrust through in her streets  
5	for israel  hath  not  been  forsaken  nor judah of his god  of the lord of hosts  though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of israel  
6	flee out of the midst of babylon  and deliver every man his soul  be not cut off in her iniquity  for this  is  the time of the lord s vengeance  he will render unto her a recompence  
7	babylon  hath been  a golden cup in the lord s hand  that made all the earth drunken  the nations have drunken of her wine  therefore the nations are mad  
8	babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed  howl for her  take balm for her pain  if so be she may be healed  
9	we would have healed babylon  but she is not healed  forsake her  and let us go every one into his own country  for her judgment reacheth unto heaven  and is lifted up  even  to the skies  
10	the lord hath brought forth our righteousness  come  and let us declare in zion the work of the lord our god  
11	make bright the arrows  gather the shields  the lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes  for his device  is  against babylon  to destroy it  because it  is  the vengeance of the lord  the vengeance of his temple  
12	set up the standard upon the walls of babylon  make the watch strong  set up the watchmen  prepare the ambushes  for the lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of babylon  
13	o thou that dwellest upon many waters  abundant in treasures  thine end is come   and  the measure of thy covetousness  
14	the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself   saying   surely i will fill thee with men  as with caterpillers  and they shall lift up a shout against thee  
15	he hath made the earth by his power  he hath established the world by his wisdom  and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding  
16	when he uttereth  his  voice   there is  a multitude of waters in the heavens  and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth  he maketh lightnings with rain  and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures  
17	every man is brutish by  his  knowledge  every founder is confounded by the graven image  for his molten image  is  falsehood  and  there is  no breath in them  
18	they  are  vanity  the work of errors  in the time of their visitation they shall perish  
19	the portion of jacob  is  not like them  for he  is  the former of all things  and  israel is  the rod of his inheritance  the lord of hosts  is  his name  
20	thou  art  my battle axe  and  weapons of war  for with thee will i break in pieces the nations  and with thee will i destroy kingdoms  
21	and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider  and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider  
22	with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman  and with thee will i break in pieces old and young  and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the maid  
23	i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock  and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen  and with thee will i break in pieces captains and rulers  
24	and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight  saith the lord  
25	behold  i  am  against thee  o destroying mountain  saith the lord  which destroyest all the earth  and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee  and roll thee down from the rocks  and will make thee a burnt mountain  
26	and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner  nor a stone for foundations  but thou shalt be desolate for ever  saith the lord  
27	set ye up a standard in the land  blow the trumpet among the nations  prepare the nations against her  call together against her the kingdoms of ararat  minni  and ashchenaz  appoint a captain against her  cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers  
28	prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes  the captains thereof  and all the rulers thereof  and all the land of his dominion  
29	and the land shall tremble and sorrow  for every purpose of the lord shall be performed against babylon  to make the land of babylon a desolation without an inhabitant  
30	the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight  they have remained in  their  holds  their might hath failed  they became as women  they have burned her dwellingplaces  her bars are broken  
31	one post shall run to meet another  and one messenger to meet another  to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at  one  end  
32	and that the passages are stopped  and the reeds they have burned with fire  and the men of war are affrighted  
33	for thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  the daughter of babylon  is  like a threshingfloor   it is  time to thresh her  yet a little while  and the time of her harvest shall come  
34	nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me  he hath crushed me  he hath made me an empty vessel  he hath swallowed me up like a dragon  he hath filled his belly with my delicates  he hath cast me out  
35	the violence done to me and to my flesh  be  upon babylon  shall the inhabitant of zion say  and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea  shall jerusalem say  
36	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  i will plead thy cause  and take vengeance for thee  and i will dry up her sea  and make her springs dry  
37	and babylon shall become heaps  a dwellingplace for dragons  an astonishment  and an hissing  without an inhabitant  
38	they shall roar together like lions  they shall yell as lions  whelps  
39	in their heat i will make their feasts  and i will make them drunken  that they may rejoice  and sleep a perpetual sleep  and not wake  saith the lord  
40	i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter  like rams with he goats  
41	how is sheshach taken  and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised  how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations  
42	the sea is come up upon babylon  she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof  
43	her cities are a desolation  a dry land  and a wilderness  a land wherein no man dwelleth  neither doth  any  son of man pass thereby  
44	and i will punish bel in babylon  and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up  and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him  yea  the wall of babylon shall fall  
45	my people  go ye out of the midst of her  and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord  
46	and lest your heart faint  and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land  a rumour shall both come  one  year  and after that in  another  year  shall come  a rumour  and violence in the land  ruler against ruler  
47	therefore  behold  the days come  that i will do judgment upon the graven images of babylon  and her whole land shall be confounded  and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her  
48	then the heaven and the earth  and all that  is  therein  shall sing for babylon  for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north  saith the lord  
49	as babylon  hath caused  the slain of israel to fall  so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth  
50	ye that have escaped the sword  go away  stand not still  remember the lord afar off  and let jerusalem come into your mind  
51	we are confounded  because we have heard reproach  shame hath covered our faces  for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lord s house  
52	wherefore  behold  the days come  saith the lord  that i will do judgment upon her graven images  and through all her land the wounded shall groan  
53	though babylon should mount up to heaven  and though she should fortify the height of her strength   yet  from me shall spoilers come unto her  saith the lord  
54	a sound of a cry  cometh  from babylon  and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans  
55	because the lord hath spoiled babylon  and destroyed out of her the great voice  when her waves do roar like great waters  a noise of their voice is uttered  
56	because the spoiler is come upon her   even  upon babylon  and her mighty men are taken  every one of their bows is broken  for the lord god of recompences shall surely requite  
57	and i will make drunk her princes  and her wise  men   her captains  and her rulers  and her mighty men  and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep  and not wake  saith the king  whose name  is  the lord of hosts  
58	thus saith the lord of hosts  the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken  and her high gates shall be burned with fire  and the people shall labour in vain  and the folk in the fire  and they shall be weary  
59 	the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah  the son of maaseiah  when he went with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign  and  this  seraiah  was  a quiet prince  
60	so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon   even  all these words that are written against babylon  
61	and jeremiah said to seraiah  when thou comest to babylon  and shalt see  and shalt read all these words  
62	then shalt thou say  o lord  thou hast spoken against this place  to cut it off  that none shall remain in it  neither man nor beast  but that it shall be desolate for ever  
63	and it shall be  when thou hast made an end of reading this book   that  thou shalt bind a stone to it  and cast it into the midst of euphrates  
64	and thou shalt say  thus shall babylon sink  and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her  and they shall be weary  thus far  are  the words of jeremiah  
jeremiah 52
1 	zedekiah  was  one and twenty years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  and his mother s name  was  hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah  
2	and he did  that which was  evil in the eyes of the lord  according to all that jehoiakim had done  
3	for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah  till he had cast them out from his presence  that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon  
4	and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign  in the tenth month  in the tenth  day  of the month   that  nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came  he and all his army  against jerusalem  and pitched against it  and built forts against it round about  
5	so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah  
6	and in the fourth month  in the ninth  day  of the month  the famine was sore in the city  so that there was no bread for the people of the land  
7	then the city was broken up  and all the men of war fled  and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls  which  was  by the king s garden   now the chaldeans  were  by the city round about   and they went by the way of the plain  
8	but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king  and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho  and all his army was scattered from him  
9	then they took the king  and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath  where he gave judgment upon him  
10	and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes  he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah  
11	then he put out the eyes of zedekiah  and the king of babylon bound him in chains  and carried him to babylon  and put him in prison till the day of his death  
12 	now in the fifth month  in the tenth  day  of the month  which  was  the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  came nebuzaradan  captain of the guard   which  served the king of babylon  into jerusalem  
13	and burned the house of the lord  and the king s house  and all the houses of jerusalem  and all the houses of the great  men   burned he with fire  
14	and all the army of the chaldeans  that  were  with the captain of the guard  brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about  
15	then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive  certain  of the poor of the people  and the residue of the people that remained in the city  and those that fell away  that fell to the king of babylon  and the rest of the multitude  
16	but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left  certain  of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen  
17	also the pillars of brass that  were  in the house of the lord  and the bases  and the brasen sea that  was  in the house of the lord  the chaldeans brake  and carried all the brass of them to babylon  
18	the caldrons also  and the shovels  and the snuffers  and the bowls  and the spoons  and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered  took they away  
19	and the basons  and the firepans  and the bowls  and the caldrons  and the candlesticks  and the spoons  and the cups   that  which  was  of gold  in  gold  and  that  which  was  of silver  in  silver  took the captain of the guard away  
20	the two pillars  one sea  and twelve brasen bulls that  were  under the bases  which king solomon had made in the house of the lord  the brass of all these vessels was without weight  
21	and  concerning  the pillars  the height of one pillar  was  eighteen cubits  and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it  and the thickness thereof  was  four fingers   it was  hollow  
22	and a chapiter of brass  was  upon it  and the height of one chapiter  was  five cubits  with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about  all  of  brass  the second pillar also and the pomegranates  were  like unto these  
23	and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side   and  all the pomegranates upon the network  were  an hundred round about  
24 	and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest  and zephaniah the second priest  and the three keepers of the door  
25	he took also out of the city an eunuch  which had the charge of the men of war  and seven men of them that were near the king s person  which were found in the city  and the principal scribe of the host  who mustered the people of the land  and threescore men of the people of the land  that were found in the midst of the city  
26	so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them  and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah  
27	and the king of babylon smote them  and put them to death in riblah in the land of hamath  thus judah was carried away captive out of his own land  
28	this  is  the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive  in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty  
29	in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons  
30	in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons  all the persons  were  four thousand and six hundred  
31 	and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah  in the twelfth month  in the five and twentieth  day  of the month   that  evilmerodach king of babylon in the  first  year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah  and brought him forth out of prison  
32	and spake kindly unto him  and set his throne above the throne of the kings that  were  with him in babylon  
33	and changed his prison garments  and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life  
34	and  for  his diet  there was a continual diet given him of the king of babylon  every day a portion until the day of his death  all the days of his life

3	judah is gone into captivity because of affliction  and because of great servitude  she dwelleth among the heathen  she findeth no rest  all her persecutors overtook her between the straits  
4	the ways of zion do mourn  because none come to the solemn feasts  all her gates are desolate  her priests sigh  her virgins are afflicted  and she  is  in bitterness

6	and from the daughter of zion all her beauty is departed  her princes are become like harts  that  find no pasture  and they are gone without strength before the pursuer  
7	jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old  when her people fell into the hand of the enemy  and none did help her  the adversaries saw her   and  did mock at her sabbaths

11	all her people sigh  they seek bread  they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul  see  o lord  and consider  for i am become vile  
12 	 is it  nothing to you  all ye that pass by  behold  and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow  which is done unto me  wherewith the lord hath afflicted  me  in the day of his fierce anger  
13	from above hath he sent fire into my bones  and it prevaileth against them  he hath spread a net for my feet  he hath turned me back  he hath made me desolate  and  faint all the day  
14	the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand  they are wreathed   and  come up upon my neck  he hath made my strength to fall  the lord hath delivered me into  their  hands   from whom  i am not able to rise up  
15	the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty  men  in the midst of me  he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men  the lord hath trodden the virgin  the daughter of judah   as  in a winepress  
16	for these  things  i weep  mine eye  mine eye runneth down with water  because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me  my children are desolate  because the enemy prevailed  
17	zion spreadeth forth her hands   and there is  none to comfort her  the lord hath commanded concerning jacob   that  his adversaries  should be  round about him  jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them  
18	the lord is righteous  for i have rebelled against his commandment  hear  i pray you  all people  and behold my sorrow  my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity  
19	i called for my lovers   but  they deceived me  my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city  while they sought their meat to relieve their souls  
20	behold  o lord  for i  am  in distress  my bowels are troubled  mine heart is turned within me  for i have grievously rebelled  abroad the sword bereaveth  at home  there is  as death  
21	they have heard that i sigh   there is  none to comfort me  all mine enemies have heard of my trouble  they are glad that thou hast done  it   thou wilt bring the day  that  thou hast called  and they shall be like unto me  
22	let all their wickedness come before thee  and do unto them  as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions  for my sighs  are  many  and my heart  is  faint  
lamentations 2
1 	how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger   and  cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel  and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger  
2	the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob  and hath not pitied  he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of judah  he hath brought  them  down to the ground  he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof  
3	he hath cut off in  his  fierce anger all the horn of israel  he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy  and he burned against jacob like a flaming fire   which  devoureth round about  
4	he hath bent his bow like an enemy  he stood with his right hand as an adversary  and slew all  that were  pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion  he poured out his fury like fire  
5	the lord was as an enemy  he hath swallowed up israel  he hath swallowed up all her palaces  he hath destroyed his strong holds  and hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation  
6	and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle  as  if it were of  a garden  he hath destroyed his places of the assembly  the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion  and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest  
7	the lord hath cast off his altar  he hath abhorred his sanctuary  he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces  they have made a noise in the house of the lord  as in the day of a solemn feast  
8	the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion  he hath stretched out a line  he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying  therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament  they languished together  
9	her gates are sunk into the ground  he hath destroyed and broken her bars  her king and her princes  are  among the gentiles  the law  is  no  more   her prophets also find no vision from the lord  
10 	the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground   and  keep silence  they have cast up dust upon their heads  they have girded themselves with sackcloth  the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground  
11	mine eyes do fail with tears  my bowels are troubled  my liver is poured upon the earth  for the destruction of the daughter of my people  because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city  
12	they say to their mothers  where  is  corn and wine  when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city  when their soul was poured out into their mothers  bosom  
13	what thing shall i take to witness for thee  what thing shall i liken to thee  o daughter of jerusalem  what shall i equal to thee  that i may comfort thee  o virgin daughter of zion  for thy breach  is  great like the sea  who can heal thee  
14	thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee  and they have not discovered thine iniquity  to turn away thy captivity  but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment  
15	all that pass by clap  their  hands at thee  they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem   saying  is  this the city that  men  call the perfection of beauty  the joy of the whole earth  
16	all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee  they hiss and gnash the teeth  they say  we have swallowed  her  up  certainly this  is  the day that we looked for  we have found  we have seen  it   
17	the lord hath done  that  which he had devised  he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old  he hath thrown down  and hath not pitied  and he hath caused  thine  enemy to rejoice over thee  he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries  
18	their heart cried unto the lord  o wall of the daughter of zion  let tears run down like a river day and night  give thyself no rest  let not the apple of thine eye cease  
19	arise  cry out in the night  in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord  lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children  that faint for hunger in the top of every street  
20	behold  o lord  and consider to whom thou hast done this  shall the women eat their fruit   and  children of a span long  shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord  
21	the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets  my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword  thou hast slain  them  in the day of thine anger  thou hast killed   and  not pitied  
22	thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about  so that in the day of the lord s anger none escaped nor remained  those that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed  
lamentations 3
1 	i  am  the man  that  hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath  
2	he hath led me  and brought  me into  darkness  but not  into  light  
3	surely against me is he turned  he turneth his hand  against me  all the day  
4	my flesh and my skin hath he made old  he hath broken my bones  
5	he hath builded against me  and compassed  me  with gall and travail  
6	he hath set me in dark places  as  they that be  dead of old  
7	he hath hedged me about  that i cannot get out  he hath made my chain heavy  
8	also when i cry and shout  he shutteth out my prayer  
9	he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone  he hath made my paths crooked  
10	he  was  unto me  as  a bear lying in wait   and as  a lion in secret places  
11	he hath turned aside my ways  and pulled me in pieces  he hath made me desolate  
12	he hath bent his bow  and set me as a mark for the arrow  
13	he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins  
14	i was a derision to all my people   and  their song all the day  
15	he hath filled me with bitterness  he hath made me drunken with wormwood  
16	he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones  he hath covered me with ashes  
17	and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace  i forgat prosperity  
18	and i said  my strength and my hope is perished from the lord  
19	remembering mine affliction and my misery  the wormwood and the gall  
20	my soul hath  them  still in remembrance  and is humbled in me  
21 	this i recall to my mind  therefore have i hope  
22	 it is of  the lord s mercies that we are not consumed  because his compassions fail not  
23	 they are  new every morning  great  is  thy faithfulness  
24	the lord  is  my portion  saith my soul  therefore will i hope in him  
25	the lord  is  good unto them that wait for him  to the soul  that  seeketh him  
26	 it is  good that  a man  should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord  
27	 it is  good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth  
28	he sitteth alone and keepeth silence  because he hath borne  it  upon him  
29	he putteth his mouth in the dust  if so be there may be hope  
30	he giveth  his  cheek to him that smiteth him  he is filled full with reproach  
31	for the lord will not cast off for ever  
32	but though he cause grief  yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies  
33	for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men  
34	to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth  
35	to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high  
36	to subvert a man in his cause  the lord approveth not  
37 	who  is  he  that  saith  and it cometh to pass   when  the lord commandeth  it  not  
38	out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good  
39	wherefore doth a living man complain  a man for the punishment of his sins  
40	let us search and try our ways  and turn again to the lord  
41	let us lift up our heart with  our  hands unto god in the heavens  
42 	we have transgressed and have rebelled  thou hast not pardoned  
43	thou hast covered with anger  and persecuted us  thou hast slain  thou hast not pitied  
44	thou hast covered thyself with a cloud  that  our  prayer should not pass through  
45	thou hast made us  as  the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people  
46	all our enemies have opened their mouths against us  
47	fear and a snare is come upon us  desolation and destruction  
48	mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people  
49	mine eye trickleth down  and ceaseth not  without any intermission  
50	till the lord look down  and behold from heaven  
51	mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city  
52	mine enemies chased me sore  like a bird  without cause  
53	they have cut off my life in the dungeon  and cast a stone upon me  
54	waters flowed over mine head   then  i said  i am cut off  
55 	i called upon thy name  o lord  out of the low dungeon  
56	thou hast heard my voice  hide not thine ear at my breathing  at my cry  
57	thou drewest near in the day  that  i called upon thee  thou saidst  fear not  
58	o lord  thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul  thou hast redeemed my life  
59	o lord  thou hast seen my wrong  judge thou my cause  
60	thou hast seen all their vengeance  and  all their imaginations against me

lamentations 4
1 	how is the gold become dim   how  is the most fine gold changed  the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street  
2	the precious sons of zion  comparable to fine gold  how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers  the work of the hands of the potter  
3	even the sea monsters draw out the breast  they give suck to their young ones  the daughter of my people  is become  cruel  like the ostriches in the wilderness  
4	the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst  the young children ask bread   and  no man breaketh  it  unto them  
5	they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets  they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills  
6	for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom  that was overthrown as in a moment  and no hands stayed on her  
7	her nazarites were purer than snow  they were whiter than milk  they were more ruddy in body than rubies  their polishing  was  of sapphire  
8	their visage is blacker than a coal  they are not known in the streets  their skin cleaveth to their bones  it is withered  it is become like a stick  
9	 they that be  slain with the sword are better than  they that be  slain with hunger  for these pine away  stricken through for  want of  the fruits of the field  
10	the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children  they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people  
11	the lord hath accomplished his fury  he hath poured out his fierce anger  and hath kindled a fire in zion  and it hath devoured the foundations thereof  
12	the kings of the earth  and all the inhabitants of the world  would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of jerusalem  
13 	for the sins of her prophets   and  the iniquities of her priests  that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her  
14	they have wandered  as  blind  men  in the streets  they have polluted themselves with blood  so that men could not touch their garments  
15	they cried unto them  depart ye   it is  unclean  depart  depart  touch not  when they fled away and wandered  they said among the heathen  they shall no more sojourn  there   
16	the anger of the lord hath divided them  he will no more regard them  they respected not the persons of the priests  they favoured not the elders  
17	as for us  our eyes as yet failed for our vain help  in our watching we have watched for a nation  that  could not save  us   
18	they hunt our steps  that we cannot go in our streets  our end is near  our days are fulfilled  for our end is come  
19	our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven  they pursued us upon the mountains  they laid wait for us in the wilderness  
20	the breath of our nostrils  the anointed of the lord  was taken in their pits  of whom we said  under his shadow we shall live among the heathen  
21 	rejoice and be glad  o daughter of edom  that dwellest in the land of uz  the cup also shall pass through unto thee  thou shalt be drunken  and shalt make thyself naked

11	they ravished the women in zion   and  the maids in the cities of judah  
12	princes are hanged up by their hand  the faces of elders were not honoured  
13	they took the young men to grind  and the children fell under the wood  
14	the elders have ceased from the gate  the young men from their musick

ezekiel 1
1 	now it came to pass in the thirtieth year  in the fourth  month   in the fifth  day  of the month  as i  was  among the captives by the river of chebar   that  the heavens were opened  and i saw visions of god  
2	in the fifth  day  of the month  which  was  the fifth year of king jehoiachin s captivity  
3	the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest  the son of buzi  in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar  and the hand of the lord was there upon him  
4 	and i looked  and  behold  a whirlwind came out of the north  a great cloud  and a fire infolding itself  and a brightness  was  about it  and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber  out of the midst of the fire  
5	also out of the midst thereof  came  the likeness of four living creatures  and this  was  their appearance  they had the likeness of a man  
6	and every one had four faces  and every one had four wings  
7	and their feet  were  straight feet  and the sole of their feet  was  like the sole of a calf s foot  and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass  
8	and  they had  the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides  and they four had their faces and their wings  
9	their wings  were  joined one to another  they turned not when they went  they went every one straight forward  
10	as for the likeness of their faces  they four had the face of a man  and the face of a lion  on the right side  and they four had the face of an ox on the left side  they four also had the face of an eagle  
11	thus  were  their faces  and their wings  were  stretched upward  two  wings  of every one  were  joined one to another  and two covered their bodies  
12	and they went every one straight forward  whither the spirit was to go  they went   and  they turned not when they went  
13	as for the likeness of the living creatures  their appearance  was  like burning coals of fire   and  like the appearance of lamps  it went up and down among the living creatures  and the fire was bright  and out of the fire went forth lightning  
14	and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning  
15 	now as i beheld the living creatures  behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures  with his four faces  
16	the appearance of the wheels and their work  was  like unto the colour of a beryl  and they four had one likeness  and their appearance and their work  was  as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel  
17	when they went  they went upon their four sides   and  they turned not when they went  
18	as for their rings  they were so high that they were dreadful  and their rings  were  full of eyes round about them four  
19	and when the living creatures went  the wheels went by them  and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth  the wheels were lifted up  
20	whithersoever the spirit was to go  they went  thither  was their  spirit to go  and the wheels were lifted up over against them  for the spirit of the living creature  was  in the wheels  
21	when those went   these  went  and when those stood   these  stood  and when those were lifted up from the earth  the wheels were lifted up over against them  for the spirit of the living creatures  was  in the wheels  
22	and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature  was  as the colour of the terrible crystal  stretched forth over their heads above  
23	and under the firmament  were  their wings straight  the one toward the other  every one had two  which covered on this side  and every one had two  which covered on that side  their bodies  
24	and when they went  i heard the noise of their wings  like the noise of great waters  as the voice of the almighty  the voice of speech  as the noise of an host  when they stood  they let down their wings  
25	and there was a voice from the firmament that  was  over their heads  when they stood   and  had let down their wings  
26 	and above the firmament that  was  over their heads  was  the likeness of a throne  as the appearance of a sapphire stone  and upon the likeness of the throne  was  the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it  
27	and i saw as the colour of amber  as the appearance of fire round about within it  from the appearance of his loins even upward  and from the appearance of his loins even downward  i saw as it were the appearance of fire  and it had brightness round about  
28	as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain  so  was  the appearance of the brightness round about  this  was  the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord  and when i saw  it   i fell upon my face  and i heard a voice of one that spake  
ezekiel 2
1 	and he said unto me  son of man  stand upon thy feet  and i will speak unto thee  
2	and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me  and set me upon my feet  that i heard him that spake unto me  
3	and he said unto me  son of man  i send thee to the children of israel  to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me  they and their fathers have transgressed against me   even  unto this very day  
4	for  they are  impudent children and stiffhearted  i do send thee unto them  and thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord god  
5	and they  whether they will hear  or whether they will forbear   for they  are  a rebellious house   yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them  
6 	and thou  son of man  be not afraid of them  neither be afraid of their words  though briers and thorns  be  with thee  and thou dost dwell among scorpions  be not afraid of their words  nor be dismayed at their looks  though they  be  a rebellious house  
7	and thou shalt speak my words unto them  whether they will hear  or whether they will forbear  for they  are  most rebellious  
8	but thou  son of man  hear what i say unto thee  be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house  open thy mouth  and eat that i give thee  
9	and when i looked  behold  an hand  was  sent unto me  and  lo  a roll of a book  was  therein  
10	and he spread it before me  and it  was  written within and without  and  there was  written therein lamentations  and mourning  and woe  
ezekiel 3
1 	moreover he said unto me  son of man  eat that thou findest  eat this roll  and go speak unto the house of israel  
2	so i opened my mouth  and he caused me to eat that roll  
3	and he said unto me  son of man  cause thy belly to eat  and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee  then did i eat  it   and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness  
4	and he said unto me  son of man  go  get thee unto the house of israel  and speak with my words unto them  
5	for thou  art  not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language   but  to the house of israel  
6	not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language  whose words thou canst not understand  surely  had i sent thee to them  they would have hearkened unto thee  
7	but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee  for they will not hearken unto me  for all the house of israel  are  impudent and hardhearted  
8	behold  i have made thy face strong against their faces  and thy forehead strong against their foreheads  
9	as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead  fear them not  neither be dismayed at their looks  though they  be  a rebellious house  
10	moreover he said unto me  son of man  all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart  and hear with thine ears  
11	and go  get thee to them of the captivity  unto the children of thy people  and speak unto them  and tell them  thus saith the lord god  whether they will hear  or whether they will forbear  
12	then the spirit took me up  and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing   saying   blessed  be  the glory of the lord from his place  
13	 i heard  also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another  and the noise of the wheels over against them  and a noise of a great rushing  
14	so the spirit lifted me up  and took me away  and i went in bitterness  in the heat of my spirit  but the hand of the lord was strong upon me  
15	then i came to them of the captivity at telabib  that dwelt by the river of chebar  and i sat where they sat  and remained there astonished among them seven days  
16 	and it came to pass at the end of seven days  that the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
17	son of man  i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel  therefore hear the word at my mouth  and give them warning from me  
18	when i say unto the wicked  thou shalt surely die  and thou givest him not warning  nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way  to save his life  the same wicked  man  shall die in his iniquity  but his blood will i require at thine hand  
19	yet if thou warn the wicked  and he turn not from his wickedness  nor from his wicked way  he shall die in his iniquity  but thou hast delivered thy soul  
20	again  when a righteous  man  doth turn from his righteousness  and commit iniquity  and i lay a stumblingblock before him  he shall die  because thou hast not given him warning  he shall die in his sin  and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered  but his blood will i require at thine hand  
21	nevertheless if thou warn the righteous  man   that the righteous sin not  and he doth not sin  he shall surely live  because he is warned  also thou hast delivered thy soul  
22 	and the hand of the lord was there upon me  and he said unto me  arise  go forth into the plain  and i will there talk with thee  
23	then i arose  and went forth into the plain  and  behold  the glory of the lord stood there  as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar  and i fell on my face  
24	then the spirit entered into me  and set me upon my feet  and spake with me  and said unto me  go  shut thyself within thine house  
25	but thou  o son of man  behold  they shall put bands upon thee  and shall bind thee with them  and thou shalt not go out among them  
26	and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth  that thou shalt be dumb  and shalt not be to them a reprover  for they  are  a rebellious house  
27	but when i speak with thee  i will open thy mouth  and thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord god  he that heareth  let him hear  and he that forbeareth  let him forbear  for they  are  a rebellious house  
ezekiel 4
1 	thou also  son of man  take thee a tile  and lay it before thee  and pourtray upon it the city   even  jerusalem  
2	and lay siege against it  and build a fort against it  and cast a mount against it  set the camp also against it  and set  battering  rams against it round about  
3	moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan  and set it  for  a wall of iron between thee and the city  and set thy face against it  and it shall be besieged  and thou shalt lay siege against it  this  shall be  a sign to the house of israel  
4	lie thou also upon thy left side  and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it   according  to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity  
5	for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity  according to the number of the days  three hundred and ninety days  so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel  
6	and when thou hast accomplished them  lie again on thy right side  and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days  i have appointed thee each day for a year  
7	therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem  and thine arm  shall be  uncovered  and thou shalt prophesy against it  
8	and  behold  i will lay bands upon thee  and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another  till thou hast ended the days of thy siege  
9 	take thou also unto thee wheat  and barley  and beans  and lentiles  and millet  and fitches  and put them in one vessel  and make thee bread thereof   according  to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side  three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof  
10	and thy meat which thou shalt eat  shall be  by weight  twenty shekels a day  from time to time shalt thou eat it  
11	thou shalt drink also water by measure  the sixth part of an hin  from time to time shalt thou drink  
12	and thou shalt eat it  as  barley cakes  and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man  in their sight  
13	and the lord said  even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles  whither i will drive them  
14	then said i  ah lord god  behold  my soul hath not been polluted  for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself  or is torn in pieces  neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth  
15	then he said unto me  lo  i have given thee cow s dung for man s dung  and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith  
16	moreover he said unto me  son of man  behold  i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem  and they shall eat bread by weight  and with care  and they shall drink water by measure  and with astonishment  
17	that they may want bread and water  and be astonied one with another  and consume away for their iniquity  
ezekiel 5
1 	and thou  son of man  take thee a sharp knife  take thee a barber s razor  and cause  it  to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard  then take thee balances to weigh  and divide the  hair   
2	thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city  when the days of the siege are fulfilled  and thou shalt take a third part   and  smite about it with a knife  and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind  and i will draw out a sword after them  
3	thou shalt also take thereof a few in number  and bind them in thy skirts  
4	then take of them again  and cast them into the midst of the fire  and burn them in the fire   for  thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel  
5 	thus saith the lord god  this  is  jerusalem  i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries  that are  round about her  
6	and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations  and my statutes more than the countries that  are  round about her  for they have refused my judgments and my statutes  they have not walked in them  
7	therefore thus saith the lord god  because ye multiplied more than the nations that  are  round about you   and  have not walked in my statutes  neither have kept my judgments  neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that  are  round about you  
8	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i  even i   am  against thee  and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations  
9	and i will do in thee that which i have not done  and whereunto i will not do any more the like  because of all thine abominations  
10	therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee  and the sons shall eat their fathers  and i will execute judgments in thee  and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds  
11	wherefore   as  i live  saith the lord god  surely  because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things  and with all thine abominations  therefore will i also diminish  thee   neither shall mine eye spare  neither will i have any pity  
12	a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence  and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee  and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee  and i will scatter a third part into all the winds  and i will draw out a sword after them  
13	thus shall mine anger be accomplished  and i will cause my fury to rest upon them  and i will be comforted  and they shall know that i the lord have spoken  it  in my zeal  when i have accomplished my fury in them  
14	moreover i will make thee waste  and a reproach among the nations that  are  round about thee  in the sight of all that pass by  
15	so it shall be a reproach and a taunt  an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that  are  round about thee  when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes  i the lord have spoken  it   
16	when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine  which shall be for  their  destruction   and  which i will send to destroy you  and i will increase the famine upon you  and will break your staff of bread  
17	so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts  and they shall bereave thee  and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee  and i will bring the sword upon thee  i the lord have spoken  it   
ezekiel 6
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face toward the mountains of israel  and prophesy against them  
3	and say  ye mountains of israel  hear the word of the lord god  thus saith the lord god to the mountains  and to the hills  to the rivers  and to the valleys  behold  i   even  i  will bring a sword upon you  and i will destroy your high places  
4	and your altars shall be desolate  and your images shall be broken  and i will cast down your slain  men  before your idols  
5	and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols  and i will scatter your bones round about your altars  
6	in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste  and the high places shall be desolate  that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate  and your idols may be broken and cease  and your images may be cut down  and your works may be abolished  
7	and the slain shall fall in the midst of you  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
8 	yet will i leave a remnant  that ye may have  some  that shall escape the sword among the nations  when ye shall be scattered through the countries  
9	and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives  because i am broken with their whorish heart  which hath departed from me  and with their eyes  which go a whoring after their idols  and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations  
10	and they shall know that i  am  the lord   and that  i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them  
11 	thus saith the lord god  smite with thine hand  and stamp with thy foot  and say  alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel  for they shall fall by the sword  by the famine  and by the pestilence  
12	he that is far off shall die of the pestilence  and he that is near shall fall by the sword  and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine  thus will i accomplish my fury upon them  
13	then shall ye know that i  am  the lord  when their slain  men  shall be among their idols round about their altars  upon every high hill  in all the tops of the mountains  and under every green tree  and under every thick oak  the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols  
14	so will i stretch out my hand upon them  and make the land desolate  yea  more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath  in all their habitations  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 7
1 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	also  thou son of man  thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel  an end  the end is come upon the four corners of the land  
3	now  is  the end  come  upon thee  and i will send mine anger upon thee  and will judge thee according to thy ways  and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations  
4	and mine eye shall not spare thee  neither will i have pity  but i will recompense thy ways upon thee  and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
5	thus saith the lord god  an evil  an only evil  behold  is come  
6	an end is come  the end is come  it watcheth for thee  behold  it is come  
7	the morning is come unto thee  o thou that dwellest in the land  the time is come  the day of trouble  is  near  and not the sounding again of the mountains  
8	now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee  and accomplish mine anger upon thee  and i will judge thee according to thy ways  and will recompense thee for all thine abominations  
9	and mine eye shall not spare  neither will i have pity  i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations  that  are in the midst of thee  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord that smiteth  
10	behold the day  behold  it is come  the morning is gone forth  the rod hath blossomed  pride hath budded  
11	violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness  none of them  shall remain   nor of their multitude  nor of any of theirs  neither  shall there be  wailing for them  
12	the time is come  the day draweth near  let not the buyer rejoice  nor the seller mourn  for wrath  is  upon all the multitude thereof  
13	for the seller shall not return to that which is sold  although they were yet alive  for the vision  is  touching the whole multitude thereof   which  shall not return  neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life  
14	they have blown the trumpet  even to make all ready  but none goeth to the battle  for my wrath  is  upon all the multitude thereof  
15	the sword  is  without  and the pestilence and the famine within  he that  is  in the field shall die with the sword  and he that  is  in the city  famine and pestilence shall devour him  
16 	but they that escape of them shall escape  and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys  all of them mourning  every one for his iniquity  
17	all hands shall be feeble  and all knees shall be weak  as  water  
18	they shall also gird  themselves  with sackcloth  and horror shall cover them  and shame  shall be  upon all faces  and baldness upon all their heads  
19	they shall cast their silver in the streets  and their gold shall be removed  their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord  they shall not satisfy their souls  neither fill their bowels  because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity  
20	as for the beauty of his ornament  he set it in majesty  but they made the images of their abominations  and  of their detestable things therein  therefore have i set it far from them  
21	and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey  and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil  and they shall pollute it  
22	my face will i turn also from them  and they shall pollute my secret  place   for the robbers shall enter into it  and defile it  
23 	make a chain  for the land is full of bloody crimes  and the city is full of violence  
24	wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen  and they shall possess their houses  i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease  and their holy places shall be defiled  
25	destruction cometh  and they shall seek peace  and  there shall be  none  
26	mischief shall come upon mischief  and rumour shall be upon rumour  then shall they seek a vision of the prophet  but the law shall perish from the priest  and counsel from the ancients  
27	the king shall mourn  and the prince shall be clothed with desolation  and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled  i will do unto them after their way  and according to their deserts will i judge them  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 8
1 	and it came to pass in the sixth year  in the sixth  month   in the fifth  day  of the month   as  i sat in mine house  and the elders of judah sat before me  that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me  
2	then i beheld  and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire  from the appearance of his loins even downward  fire  and from his loins even upward  as the appearance of brightness  as the colour of amber  
3	and he put forth the form of an hand  and took me by a lock of mine head  and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven  and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem  to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north  where  was  the seat of the image of jealousy  which provoketh to jealousy  
4	and  behold  the glory of the god of israel  was  there  according to the vision that i saw in the plain  
5	then said he unto me  son of man  lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north  so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north  and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry  
6	he said furthermore unto me  son of man  seest thou what they do   even  the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here  that i should go far off from my sanctuary  but turn thee yet again   and  thou shalt see greater abominations  
7 	and he brought me to the door of the court  and when i looked  behold a hole in the wall  
8	then said he unto me  son of man  dig now in the wall  and when i had digged in the wall  behold a door  
9	and he said unto me  go in  and behold the wicked abominations that they do here  
10	so i went in and saw  and behold every form of creeping things  and abominable beasts  and all the idols of the house of israel  pourtrayed upon the wall round about  
11	and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel  and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan  with every man his censer in his hand  and a thick cloud of incense went up  
12	then said he unto me  son of man  hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark  every man in the chambers of his imagery  for they say  the lord seeth us not  the lord hath forsaken the earth  
13 	he said also unto me  turn thee yet again   and  thou shalt see greater abominations that they do  
14	then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord s house which  was  toward the north  and  behold  there sat women weeping for tammuz  
15	then said he unto me  hast thou seen  this   o son of man  turn thee yet again   and  thou shalt see greater abominations than these  
16	and he brought me into the inner court of the lord s house  and  behold  at the door of the temple of the lord  between the porch and the altar   were  about five and twenty men  with their backs toward the temple of the lord  and their faces toward the east  and they worshipped the sun toward the east  
17	then he said unto me  hast thou seen  this   o son of man  is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here  for they have filled the land with violence  and have returned to provoke me to anger  and  lo  they put the branch to their nose  
18	therefore will i also deal in fury  mine eye shall not spare  neither will i have pity  and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice   yet  will i not hear them  
ezekiel 9
1 	he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice  saying  cause them that have charge over the city to draw near  even every man  with  his destroying weapon in his hand  
2	and  behold  six men came from the way of the higher gate  which lieth toward the north  and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand  and one man among them  was  clothed with linen  with a writer s inkhorn by his side  and they went in  and stood beside the brasen altar  
3	and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub  whereupon he was  to the threshold of the house  and he called to the man clothed with linen  which  had  the writer s inkhorn by his side  
4	and the lord said unto him  go through the midst of the city  through the midst of jerusalem  and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof  
5 	and to the others he said in mine hearing  go ye after him through the city  and smite  let not your eye spare  neither have ye pity  
6	slay utterly old  and  young  both maids  and little children  and women  but come not near any man upon whom  is  the mark  and begin at my sanctuary  then they began at the ancient men which  were  before the house  
7	and he said unto them  defile the house  and fill the courts with the slain  go ye forth  and they went forth  and slew in the city  
8	and it came to pass  while they were slaying them  and i was left  that i fell upon my face  and cried  and said  ah lord god  wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem  
9	then said he unto me  the iniquity of the house of israel and judah  is  exceeding great  and the land is full of blood  and the city full of perverseness  for they say  the lord hath forsaken the earth  and the lord seeth not  
10	and as for me also  mine eye shall not spare  neither will i have pity   but  i will recompense their way upon their head  
11	and  behold  the man clothed with linen  which  had  the inkhorn by his side  reported the matter  saying  i have done as thou hast commanded me  
ezekiel 10
1 	then i looked  and  behold  in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone  as the appearance of the likeness of a throne  
2	and he spake unto the man clothed with linen  and said  go in between the wheels   even  under the cherub  and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims  and scatter  them  over the city  and he went in in my sight  
3	now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house  when the man went in  and the cloud filled the inner court  
4	then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub   and stood  over the threshold of the house  and the house was filled with the cloud  and the court was full of the brightness of the lord s glory  
5	and the sound of the cherubims  wings was heard  even  to the outer court  as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh  
6	and it came to pass   that  when he had commanded the man clothed with linen  saying  take fire from between the wheels  from between the cherubims  then he went in  and stood beside the wheels  
7	and  one  cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that  was  between the cherubims  and took  thereof   and put  it  into the hands of  him that was  clothed with linen  who took  it   and went out  
8 	and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man s hand under their wings  
9	and when i looked  behold the four wheels by the cherubims  one wheel by one cherub  and another wheel by another cherub  and the appearance of the wheels  was  as the colour of a beryl stone  
10	and  as for  their appearances  they four had one likeness  as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel  
11	when they went  they went upon their four sides  they turned not as they went  but to the place whither the head looked they followed it  they turned not as they went  
12	and their whole body  and their backs  and their hands  and their wings  and the wheels   were  full of eyes round about   even  the wheels that they four had  
13	as for the wheels  it was cried unto them in my hearing  o wheel  
14	and every one had four faces  the first face  was  the face of a cherub  and the second face  was  the face of a man  and the third the face of a lion  and the fourth the face of an eagle  
15	and the cherubims were lifted up  this  is  the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar  
16	and when the cherubims went  the wheels went by them  and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth  the same wheels also turned not from beside them  
17	when they stood   these  stood  and when they were lifted up   these  lifted up themselves  also   for the spirit of the living creature  was  in them  
18	then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house  and stood over the cherubims  
19	and the cherubims lifted up their wings  and mounted up from the earth in my sight  when they went out  the wheels also  were  beside them  and  every one  stood at the door of the east gate of the lord s house  and the glory of the god of israel  was  over them above  
20	this  is  the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar  and i knew that they  were  the cherubims  
21	every one had four faces apiece  and every one four wings  and the likeness of the hands of a man  was  under their wings  
22	and the likeness of their faces  was  the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar  their appearances and themselves  they went every one straight forward  
ezekiel 11
1 	moreover the spirit lifted me up  and brought me unto the east gate of the lord s house  which looketh eastward  and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men  among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur  and pelatiah the son of benaiah  princes of the people  
2	then said he unto me  son of man  these  are  the men that devise mischief  and give wicked counsel in this city  
3	which say   it is  not near  let us build houses  this  city is  the caldron  and we  be  the flesh  
4	therefore prophesy against them  prophesy  o son of man  
5	and the spirit of the lord fell upon me  and said unto me  speak  thus saith the lord  thus have ye said  o house of israel  for i know the things that come into your mind   every one of  them  
6	ye have multiplied your slain in this city  and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain  
7	therefore thus saith the lord god  your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it  they  are  the flesh  and this  city is  the caldron  but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it  
8	ye have feared the sword  and i will bring a sword upon you  saith the lord god  
9	and i will bring you out of the midst thereof  and deliver you into the hands of strangers  and will execute judgments among you  
10	ye shall fall by the sword  i will judge you in the border of israel  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
11	this  city  shall not be your caldron  neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof   but  i will judge you in the border of israel  
12	and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  for ye have not walked in my statutes  neither executed my judgments  but have done after the manners of the heathen that  are  round about you  
13	and it came to pass  when i prophesied  that pelatiah the son of benaiah died  then fell i down upon my face  and cried with a loud voice  and said  ah lord god  wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel  
14 	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
15	son of man  thy brethren   even  thy brethren  the men of thy kindred  and all the house of israel wholly   are  they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said  get you far from the lord  unto us is this land given in possession  
16	therefore say  thus saith the lord god  although i have cast them far off among the heathen  and although i have scattered them among the countries  yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come  
17	therefore say  thus saith the lord god  i will even gather you from the people  and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered  and i will give you the land of israel  
18	and they shall come thither  and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence  
19	and i will give them one heart  and i will put a new spirit within you  and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh  and will give them an heart of flesh  
20	that they may walk in my statutes  and keep mine ordinances  and do them  and they shall be my people  and i will be their god  
21	but  as for them  whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations  i will recompense their way upon their own heads  saith the lord god  
22 	then did the cherubims lift up their wings  and the wheels beside them  and the glory of the god of israel  was  over them above  
23	and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city  and stood upon the mountain which  is  on the east side of the city  
24	afterwards the spirit took me up  and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea  to them of the captivity  so the vision that i had seen went up from me  
25	then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me  
ezekiel 12
1 	the word of the lord also came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house  which have eyes to see  and see not  they have ears to hear  and hear not  for they  are  a rebellious house  
3	therefore  thou son of man  prepare thee stuff for removing  and remove by day in their sight  and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight  it may be they will consider  though they  be  a rebellious house  
4	then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight  as stuff for removing  and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight  as they that go forth into captivity  
5	dig thou through the wall in their sight  and carry out thereby  
6	in their sight shalt thou bear  it  upon  thy  shoulders   and  carry  it  forth in the twilight  thou shalt cover thy face  that thou see not the ground  for i have set thee  for  a sign unto the house of israel  
7	and i did so as i was commanded  i brought forth my stuff by day  as stuff for captivity  and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand  i brought  it  forth in the twilight   and  i bare  it  upon  my  shoulder in their sight  
8	and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me  saying  
9	son of man  hath not the house of israel  the rebellious house  said unto thee  what doest thou  
10	say thou unto them  thus saith the lord god  this burden  concerneth  the prince in jerusalem  and all the house of israel that  are  among them  
11	say  i  am  your sign  like as i have done  so shall it be done unto them  they shall remove  and  go into captivity  
12	and the prince that  is  among them shall bear upon  his  shoulder in the twilight  and shall go forth  they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby  he shall cover his face  that he see not the ground with  his  eyes  
13	my net also will i spread upon him  and he shall be taken in my snare  and i will bring him to babylon  to  the land of the chaldeans  yet shall he not see it  though he shall die there  
14	and i will scatter toward every wind all that  are  about him to help him  and all his bands  and i will draw out the sword after them  
15	and they shall know that i  am  the lord  when i shall scatter them among the nations  and disperse them in the countries  
16	but i will leave a few men of them from the sword  from the famine  and from the pestilence  that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
17 	moreover the word of the lord came to me  saying  
18	son of man  eat thy bread with quaking  and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness  
19	and say unto the people of the land  thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem   and  of the land of israel  they shall eat their bread with carefulness  and drink their water with astonishment  that her land may be desolate from all that is therein  because of the violence of all them that dwell therein  
20	and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste  and the land shall be desolate  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
21 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
22	son of man  what  is  that proverb  that  ye have in the land of israel  saying  the days are prolonged  and every vision faileth  
23	tell them therefore  thus saith the lord god  i will make this proverb to cease  and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel  but say unto them  the days are at hand  and the effect of every vision  
24	for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel  
25	for i  am  the lord  i will speak  and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass  it shall be no more prolonged  for in your days  o rebellious house  will i say the word  and will perform it  saith the lord god  
26	again the word of the lord came to me  saying  
27	son of man  behold   they of  the house of israel say  the vision that he seeth  is  for many days  to come   and he prophesieth of the times  that are  far off  
28	therefore say unto them  thus saith the lord god  there shall none of my words be prolonged any more  but the word which i have spoken shall be done  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 13
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy  and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts  hear ye the word of the lord  
3	thus saith the lord god  woe unto the foolish prophets  that follow their own spirit  and have seen nothing  
4	o israel  thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts  
5	ye have not gone up into the gaps  neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord  
6	they have seen vanity and lying divination  saying  the lord saith  and the lord hath not sent them  and they have made  others  to hope that they would confirm the word  
7	have ye not seen a vain vision  and have ye not spoken a lying divination  whereas ye say  the lord saith  it   albeit i have not spoken  
8	therefore thus saith the lord god  because ye have spoken vanity  and seen lies  therefore  behold  i  am  against you  saith the lord god  
9	and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity  and that divine lies  they shall not be in the assembly of my people  neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel  neither shall they enter into the land of israel  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord god  
10 	because  even because they have seduced my people  saying  peace  and  there was  no peace  and one built up a wall  and  lo  others daubed it with untempered  morter   
11	say unto them which daub  it  with untempered  morter   that it shall fall  there shall be an overflowing shower  and ye  o great hailstones  shall fall  and a stormy wind shall rend  it   
12	lo  when the wall is fallen  shall it not be said unto you  where  is  the daubing wherewith ye have daubed  it   
13	therefore thus saith the lord god  i will even rend  it  with a stormy wind in my fury  and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger  and great hailstones in  my  fury to consume  it   
14	so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered  morter   and bring it down to the ground  so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered  and it shall fall  and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
15	thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall  and upon them that have daubed it with untempered  morter   and will say unto you  the wall  is  no  more   neither they that daubed it  
16	 to wit   the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem  and which see visions of peace for her  and  there is  no peace  saith the lord god  
17 	likewise  thou son of man  set thy face against the daughters of thy people  which prophesy out of their own heart  and prophesy thou against them  
18	and say  thus saith the lord god  woe to the  women  that sew pillows to all armholes  and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls  will ye hunt the souls of my people  and will ye save the souls alive  that come  unto you  
19	and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread  to slay the souls that should not die  and to save the souls alive that should not live  by your lying to my people that hear  your  lies  
20	wherefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against your pillows  wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make  them  fly  and i will tear them from your arms  and will let the souls go   even  the souls that ye hunt to make  them  fly  
21	your kerchiefs also will i tear  and deliver my people out of your hand  and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
22	because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad  whom i have not made sad  and strengthened the hands of the wicked  that he should not return from his wicked way  by promising him life  
23	therefore ye shall see no more vanity  nor divine divinations  for i will deliver my people out of your hand  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 14
1 	then came certain of the elders of israel unto me  and sat before me  
2	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
3	son of man  these men have set up their idols in their heart  and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face  should i be enquired of at all by them  
4	therefore speak unto them  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart  and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face  and cometh to the prophet  i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols  
5	that i may take the house of israel in their own heart  because they are all estranged from me through their idols  
6	therefore say unto the house of israel  thus saith the lord god  repent  and turn  yourselves  from your idols  and turn away your faces from all your abominations  
7	for every one of the house of israel  or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel  which separateth himself from me  and setteth up his idols in his heart  and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face  and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me  i the lord will answer him by myself  
8	and i will set my face against that man  and will make him a sign and a proverb  and i will cut him off from the midst of my people  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
9	and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing  i the lord have deceived that prophet  and i will stretch out my hand upon him  and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel  
10	and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity  the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh  unto him   
11	that the house of israel may go no more astray from me  neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions  but that they may be my people  and i may be their god  saith the lord god  
12 	the word of the lord came again to me  saying  
13	son of man  when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously  then will i stretch out mine hand upon it  and will break the staff of the bread thereof  and will send famine upon it  and will cut off man and beast from it  
14	though these three men  noah  daniel  and job  were in it  they should deliver  but  their own souls by their righteousness  saith the lord god  
15	if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land  and they spoil it  so that it be desolate  that no man may pass through because of the beasts  
16	 though  these three men  were  in it   as  i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters  they only shall be delivered  but the land shall be desolate  
17	or  if  i bring a sword upon that land  and say  sword  go through the land  so that i cut off man and beast from it  
18	though these three men  were  in it   as  i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters  but they only shall be delivered themselves  
19	or  if  i send a pestilence into that land  and pour out my fury upon it in blood  to cut off from it man and beast  
20	though noah  daniel  and job   were  in it   as  i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliver neither son nor daughter  they shall  but  deliver their own souls by their righteousness  
21	for thus saith the lord god  how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem  the sword  and the famine  and the noisome beast  and the pestilence  to cut off from it man and beast  
22	yet  behold  therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth   both  sons and daughters  behold  they shall come forth unto you  and ye shall see their way and their doings  and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem   even  concerning all that i have brought upon it  
23	and they shall comfort you  when ye see their ways and their doings  and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 15
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  what is the vine tree more than any tree   or than  a branch which is among the trees of the forest  
3	shall wood be taken thereof to do any work  or will  men  take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon  
4	behold  it is cast into the fire for fuel  the fire devoureth both the ends of it  and the midst of it is burned  is it meet for  any  work  
5	behold  when it was whole  it was meet for no work  how much less shall it be meet yet for  any  work  when the fire hath devoured it  and it is burned  
6	therefore thus saith the lord god  as the vine tree among the trees of the forest  which i have given to the fire for fuel  so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem  
7	and i will set my face against them  they shall go out from  one  fire  and  another  fire shall devour them  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  when i set my face against them  
8	and i will make the land desolate  because they have committed a trespass  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 16
1 	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  cause jerusalem to know her abominations  
3	and say  thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem  thy birth and thy nativity  is  of the land of canaan  thy father  was  an amorite  and thy mother an hittite  
4	and  as for  thy nativity  in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut  neither wast thou washed in water to supple  thee   thou wast not salted at all  nor swaddled at all  
5	none eye pitied thee  to do any of these unto thee  to have compassion upon thee  but thou wast cast out in the open field  to the lothing of thy person  in the day that thou wast born  
6 	and when i passed by thee  and saw thee polluted in thine own blood  i said unto thee  when thou wast  in thy blood  live  yea  i said unto thee  when thou wast  in thy blood  live  
7	i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field  and thou hast increased and waxen great  and thou art come to excellent ornaments   thy  breasts are fashioned  and thine hair is grown  whereas thou  wast  naked and bare  
8	now when i passed by thee  and looked upon thee  behold  thy time  was  the time of love  and i spread my skirt over thee  and covered thy nakedness  yea  i sware unto thee  and entered into a covenant with thee  saith the lord god  and thou becamest mine  
9	then washed i thee with water  yea  i throughly washed away thy blood from thee  and i anointed thee with oil  
10	i clothed thee also with broidered work  and shod thee with badgers  skin  and i girded thee about with fine linen  and i covered thee with silk  
11	i decked thee also with ornaments  and i put bracelets upon thy hands  and a chain on thy neck  
12	and i put a jewel on thy forehead  and earrings in thine ears  and a beautiful crown upon thine head  
13	thus wast thou decked with gold and silver  and thy raiment  was of  fine linen  and silk  and broidered work  thou didst eat fine flour  and honey  and oil  and thou wast exceeding beautiful  and thou didst prosper into a kingdom  
14	and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty  for it  was  perfect through my comeliness  which i had put upon thee  saith the lord god  
15 	but thou didst trust in thine own beauty  and playedst the harlot because of thy renown  and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by  his it was  
16	and of thy garments thou didst take  and deckedst thy high places with divers colours  and playedst the harlot thereupon   the like things  shall not come  neither shall it be  so   
17	thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver  which i had given thee  and madest to thyself images of men  and didst commit whoredom with them  
18	and tookest thy broidered garments  and coveredst them  and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them  
19	my meat also which i gave thee  fine flour  and oil  and honey   wherewith  i fed thee  thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour  and  thus  it was  saith the lord god  
20	moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters  whom thou hast borne unto me  and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured   is this  of thy whoredoms a small matter  
21	that thou hast slain my children  and delivered them to cause them to pass through  the fire  for them  
22	and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth  when thou wast naked and bare   and  wast polluted in thy blood  
23	and it came to pass after all thy wickedness   woe  woe unto thee  saith the lord god   
24	 that  thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place  and hast made thee an high place in every street  
25	thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way  and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred  and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by  and multiplied thy whoredoms  
26	thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbours  great of flesh  and hast increased thy whoredoms  to provoke me to anger  
27	behold  therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee  and have diminished thine ordinary  food   and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee  the daughters of the philistines  which are ashamed of thy lewd way  
28	thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians  because thou wast unsatiable  yea  thou hast played the harlot with them  and yet couldest not be satisfied  
29	thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea  and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith  
30	how weak is thine heart  saith the lord god  seeing thou doest all these  things   the work of an imperious whorish woman  
31	in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way  and makest thine high place in every street  and hast not been as an harlot  in that thou scornest hire  
32	 but as  a wife that committeth adultery   which  taketh strangers instead of her husband  
33	they give gifts to all whores  but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers  and hirest them  that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom  
34	and the contrary is in thee from  other  women in thy whoredoms  whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms  and in that thou givest a reward  and no reward is given unto thee  therefore thou art contrary  
35 	wherefore  o harlot  hear the word of the lord  
36	thus saith the lord god  because thy filthiness was poured out  and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers  and with all the idols of thy abominations  and by the blood of thy children  which thou didst give unto them  
37	behold  therefore i will gather all thy lovers  with whom thou hast taken pleasure  and all  them  that thou hast loved  with all  them  that thou hast hated  i will even gather them round about against thee  and will discover thy nakedness unto them  that they may see all thy nakedness  
38	and i will judge thee  as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged  and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy  
39	and i will also give thee into their hand  and they shall throw down thine eminent place  and shall break down thy high places  they shall strip thee also of thy clothes  and shall take thy fair jewels  and leave thee naked and bare  
40	they shall also bring up a company against thee  and they shall stone thee with stones  and thrust thee through with their swords  
41	and they shall burn thine houses with fire  and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women  and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot  and thou also shalt give no hire any more  
42	so will i make my fury toward thee to rest  and my jealousy shall depart from thee  and i will be quiet  and will be no more angry  
43	because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth  but hast fretted me in all these  things   behold  therefore i also will recompense thy way upon  thine  head  saith the lord god  and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations  
44 	behold  every one that useth proverbs shall use  this  proverb against thee  saying  as  is  the mother   so is  her daughter  
45	thou  art  thy mother s daughter  that lotheth her husband and her children  and thou  art  the sister of thy sisters  which lothed their husbands and their children  your mother  was  an hittite  and your father an amorite  
46	and thine elder sister  is  samaria  she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand  and thy younger sister  that dwelleth at thy right hand   is  sodom and her daughters  
47	yet hast thou not walked after their ways  nor done after their abominations  but  as  if that were  a very little  thing   thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways  
48	 as  i live  saith the lord god  sodom thy sister hath not done  she nor her daughters  as thou hast done  thou and thy daughters  
49	behold  this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom  pride  fulness of bread  and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters  neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy  
50	and they were haughty  and committed abomination before me  therefore i took them away as i saw  good   
51	neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins  but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they  and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done  
52	thou also  which hast judged thy sisters  bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they  they are more righteous than thou  yea  be thou confounded also  and bear thy shame  in that thou hast justified thy sisters  
53	when i shall bring again their captivity  the captivity of sodom and her daughters  and the captivity of samaria and her daughters  then  will i bring again  the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them  
54	that thou mayest bear thine own shame  and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done  in that thou art a comfort unto them  
55	when thy sisters  sodom and her daughters  shall return to their former estate  and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate  then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate  
56	for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride  
57	before thy wickedness was discovered  as at the time of  thy  reproach of the daughters of syria  and all  that are  round about her  the daughters of the philistines  which despise thee round about  
58	thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations  saith the lord  
59	for thus saith the lord god  i will even deal with thee as thou hast done  which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant  
60 	nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth  and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant  
61	then thou shalt remember thy ways  and be ashamed  when thou shalt receive thy sisters  thine elder and thy younger  and i will give them unto thee for daughters  but not by thy covenant  
62	and i will establish my covenant with thee  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  
63	that thou mayest remember  and be confounded  and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame  when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 17
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  put forth a riddle  and speak a parable unto the house of israel  
3	and say  thus saith the lord god  a great eagle with great wings  longwinged  full of feathers  which had divers colours  came unto lebanon  and took the highest branch of the cedar  
4	he cropped off the top of his young twigs  and carried it into a land of traffick  he set it in a city of merchants  
5	he took also of the seed of the land  and planted it in a fruitful field  he placed  it  by great waters   and  set it  as  a willow tree  
6	and it grew  and became a spreading vine of low stature  whose branches turned toward him  and the roots thereof were under him  so it became a vine  and brought forth branches  and shot forth sprigs  
7	there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers  and  behold  this vine did bend her roots toward him  and shot forth her branches toward him  that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation  
8	it was planted in a good soil by great waters  that it might bring forth branches  and that it might bear fruit  that it might be a goodly vine  
9	say thou  thus saith the lord god  shall it prosper  shall he not pull up the roots thereof  and cut off the fruit thereof  that it wither  it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring  even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof  
10	yea  behold   being  planted  shall it prosper  shall it not utterly wither  when the east wind toucheth it  it shall wither in the furrows where it grew  
11	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
12	say now to the rebellious house  know ye not what these  things mean   tell  them   behold  the king of babylon is come to jerusalem  and hath taken the king thereof  and the princes thereof  and led them with him to babylon  
13	and hath taken of the king s seed  and made a covenant with him  and hath taken an oath of him  he hath also taken the mighty of the land  
14	that the kingdom might be base  that it might not lift itself up   but  that by keeping of his covenant it might stand  
15	but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt  that they might give him horses and much people  shall he prosper  shall he escape that doeth such  things   or shall he break the covenant  and be delivered  
16	 as  i live  saith the lord god  surely in the place  where  the king  dwelleth  that made him king  whose oath he despised  and whose covenant he brake   even  with him in the midst of babylon he shall die  
17	neither shall pharaoh with  his  mighty army and great company make for him in the war  by casting up mounts  and building forts  to cut off many persons  
18	seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant  when  lo  he had given his hand  and hath done all these  things   he shall not escape  
19	therefore thus saith the lord god   as  i live  surely mine oath that he hath despised  and my covenant that he hath broken  even it will i recompense upon his own head  
20	and i will spread my net upon him  and he shall be taken in my snare  and i will bring him to babylon  and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me  
21	and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword  and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds  and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken  it   
22 	thus saith the lord god  i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar  and will set  it   i will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one  and will plant  it  upon an high mountain and eminent  
23	in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it  and it shall bring forth boughs  and bear fruit  and be a goodly cedar  and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing  in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell  
24	and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree  have exalted the low tree  have dried up the green tree  and have made the dry tree to flourish  i the lord have spoken and have done  it   
ezekiel 18
1 	the word of the lord came unto me again  saying  
2	what mean ye  that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel  saying  the fathers have eaten sour grapes  and the children s teeth are set on edge  
3	 as  i live  saith the lord god  ye shall not have  occasion  any more to use this proverb in israel  
4	behold  all souls are mine  as the soul of the father  so also the soul of the son is mine  the soul that sinneth  it shall die  
5	but if a man be just  and do that which is lawful and right  
6	 and  hath not eaten upon the mountains  neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel  neither hath defiled his neighbour s wife  neither hath come near to a menstruous woman  
7	and hath not oppressed any   but  hath restored to the debtor his pledge  hath spoiled none by violence  hath given his bread to the hungry  and hath covered the naked with a garment  
8	he  that  hath not given forth upon usury  neither hath taken any increase   that  hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity  hath executed true judgment between man and man  
9	hath walked in my statutes  and hath kept my judgments  to deal truly  he  is  just  he shall surely live  saith the lord god  
10 	if he beget a son  that is  a robber  a shedder of blood  and  that  doeth the like to  any  one of these  things   
11	and that doeth not any of those  duties   but even hath eaten upon the mountains  and defiled his neighbour s wife  
12	hath oppressed the poor and needy  hath spoiled by violence  hath not restored the pledge  and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols  hath committed abomination  
13	hath given forth upon usury  and hath taken increase  shall he then live  he shall not live  he hath done all these abominations  he shall surely die  his blood shall be upon him  
14	now  lo   if  he beget a son  that seeth all his father s sins which he hath done  and considereth  and doeth not such like  
15	 that  hath not eaten upon the mountains  neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel  hath not defiled his neighbour s wife  
16	neither hath oppressed any  hath not withholden the pledge  neither hath spoiled by violence   but  hath given his bread to the hungry  and hath covered the naked with a garment  
17	 that  hath taken off his hand from the poor   that  hath not received usury nor increase  hath executed my judgments  hath walked in my statutes  he shall not die for the iniquity of his father  he shall surely live  
18	 as for  his father  because he cruelly oppressed  spoiled his brother by violence  and did  that  which  is  not good among his people  lo  even he shall die in his iniquity  
19	yet say ye  why  doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father  when the son hath done that which is lawful and right   and  hath kept all my statutes  and hath done them  he shall surely live  
20	the soul that sinneth  it shall die  the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father  neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son  the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him  and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him  
21 	but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed  and keep all my statutes  and do that which is lawful and right  he shall surely live  he shall not die  
22	all his transgressions that he hath committed  they shall not be mentioned unto him  in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live  
23	have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die  saith the lord god   and  not that he should return from his ways  and live  
24	but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness  and committeth iniquity   and  doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked  man  doeth  shall he live  all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned  in his trespass that he hath trespassed  and in his sin that he hath sinned  in them shall he die  
25	yet ye say  the way of the lord is not equal  hear now  o house of israel  is not my way equal  are not your ways unequal  
26	when a righteous  man  turneth away from his righteousness  and committeth iniquity  and dieth in them  for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die  
27	again  when the wicked  man  turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed  and doeth that which is lawful and right  he shall save his soul alive  
28	because he considereth  and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed  he shall surely live  he shall not die  
29	yet saith the house of israel  the way of the lord is not equal  o house of israel  are not my ways equal  are not your ways unequal  
30 	therefore i will judge you  o house of israel  every one according to his ways  saith the lord god  repent  and turn  yourselves  from all your transgressions  so iniquity shall not be your ruin  
31	cast away from you all your transgressions  whereby ye have transgressed  and make you a new heart and a new spirit  for why will ye die  o house of israel  
32	for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth  saith the lord god  wherefore turn  yourselves   and live ye  
ezekiel 19
1 	moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel  
2	and say  what  is  thy mother  a lioness  she lay down among lions  she nourished her whelps among young lions  
3	and she brought up one of her whelps  it became a young lion  and it learned to catch the prey  it devoured men  
4	the nations also heard of him  he was taken in their pit  and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt  
5	now when she saw that she had waited   and  her hope was lost  then she took another of her whelps   and  made him a young lion  
6	and he went up and down among the lions  he became a young lion  and learned to catch the prey   and  devoured men  
7	and he knew their desolate palaces  and he laid waste their cities  and the land was desolate  and the fulness thereof  by the noise of his roaring  
8	then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces  and spread their net over him  he was taken in their pit  
9	and they put him in ward in chains  and brought him to the king of babylon  they brought him into holds  that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel  
10 	thy mother  is  like a vine in thy blood  planted by the waters  she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters  
11	and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule  and her stature was exalted among the thick branches  and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches  
12	but she was plucked up in fury  she was cast down to the ground  and the east wind dried up her fruit  her strong rods were broken and withered  the fire consumed them  
13	and now she  is  planted in the wilderness  in a dry and thirsty ground  
14	and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches   which  hath devoured her fruit  so that she hath no strong rod  to be  a sceptre to rule  this  is  a lamentation  and shall be for a lamentation  
ezekiel 20
1 	and it came to pass in the seventh year  in the fifth  month   the tenth  day  of the month   that  certain of the elders of israel came to enquire of the lord  and sat before me  
2	then came the word of the lord unto me  saying  
3	son of man  speak unto the elders of israel  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  are ye come to enquire of me   as  i live  saith the lord god  i will not be enquired of by you  
4	wilt thou judge them  son of man  wilt thou judge  them   cause them to know the abominations of their fathers  
5 	and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  in the day when i chose israel  and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob  and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt  when i lifted up mine hand unto them  saying  i  am  the lord your god  
6	in the day  that  i lifted up mine hand unto them  to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them  flowing with milk and honey  which  is  the glory of all lands  
7	then said i unto them  cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes  and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt  i  am  the lord your god  
8	but they rebelled against me  and would not hearken unto me  they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes  neither did they forsake the idols of egypt  then i said  i will pour out my fury upon them  to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt  
9	but i wrought for my name s sake  that it should not be polluted before the heathen  among whom they  were   in whose sight i made myself known unto them  in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt  
10 	wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt  and brought them into the wilderness  
11	and i gave them my statutes  and shewed them my judgments  which  if  a man do  he shall even live in them  
12	moreover also i gave them my sabbaths  to be a sign between me and them  that they might know that i  am  the lord that sanctify them  
13	but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness  they walked not in my statutes  and they despised my judgments  which  if  a man do  he shall even live in them  and my sabbaths they greatly polluted  then i said  i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness  to consume them  
14	but i wrought for my name s sake  that it should not be polluted before the heathen  in whose sight i brought them out  
15	yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness  that i would not bring them into the land which i had given  them   flowing with milk and honey  which  is  the glory of all lands  
16	because they despised my judgments  and walked not in my statutes  but polluted my sabbaths  for their heart went after their idols  
17	nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them  neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness  
18	but i said unto their children in the wilderness  walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers  neither observe their judgments  nor defile yourselves with their idols  
19	i  am  the lord your god  walk in my statutes  and keep my judgments  and do them  
20	and hallow my sabbaths  and they shall be a sign between me and you  that ye may know that i  am  the lord your god  
21	notwithstanding the children rebelled against me  they walked not in my statutes  neither kept my judgments to do them  which  if  a man do  he shall even live in them  they polluted my sabbaths  then i said  i would pour out my fury upon them  to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness  
22	nevertheless i withdrew mine hand  and wrought for my name s sake  that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen  in whose sight i brought them forth  
23	i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness  that i would scatter them among the heathen  and disperse them through the countries  
24	because they had not executed my judgments  but had despised my statutes  and had polluted my sabbaths  and their eyes were after their fathers  idols  
25	wherefore i gave them also statutes  that were  not good  and judgments whereby they should not live  
26	and i polluted them in their own gifts  in that they caused to pass through  the fire  all that openeth the womb  that i might make them desolate  to the end that they might know that i  am  the lord  
27 	therefore  son of man  speak unto the house of israel  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me  in that they have committed a trespass against me  
28	 for  when i had brought them into the land   for  the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to them  then they saw every high hill  and all the thick trees  and they offered there their sacrifices  and there they presented the provocation of their offering  there also they made their sweet savour  and poured out there their drink offerings  
29	then i said unto them  what  is  the high place whereunto ye go  and the name thereof is called bamah unto this day  
30	wherefore say unto the house of israel  thus saith the lord god  are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers  and commit ye whoredom after their abominations  
31	for when ye offer your gifts  when ye make your sons to pass through the fire  ye pollute yourselves with all your idols  even unto this day  and shall i be enquired of by you  o house of israel   as  i live  saith the lord god  i will not be enquired of by you  
32	and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all  that ye say  we will be as the heathen  as the families of the countries  to serve wood and stone  
33 	 as  i live  saith the lord god  surely with a mighty hand  and with a stretched out arm  and with fury poured out  will i rule over you  
34	and i will bring you out from the people  and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered  with a mighty hand  and with a stretched out arm  and with fury poured out  
35	and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people  and there will i plead with you face to face  
36	like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt  so will i plead with you  saith the lord god  
37	and i will cause you to pass under the rod  and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant  
38	and i will purge out from among you the rebels  and them that transgress against me  i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn  and they shall not enter into the land of israel  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
39	as for you  o house of israel  thus saith the lord god  go ye  serve ye every one his idols  and hereafter  also   if ye will not hearken unto me  but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts  and with your idols  
40	for in mine holy mountain  in the mountain of the height of israel  saith the lord god  there shall all the house of israel  all of them in the land  serve me  there will i accept them  and there will i require your offerings  and the firstfruits of your oblations  with all your holy things  
41	i will accept you with your sweet savour  when i bring you out from the people  and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered  and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen  
42	and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  when i shall bring you into the land of israel  into the country  for  the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers  
43	and there shall ye remember your ways  and all your doings  wherein ye have been defiled  and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed  
44	and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  when i have wrought with you for my name s sake  not according to your wicked ways  nor according to your corrupt doings  o ye house of israel  saith the lord god  
45 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
46	son of man  set thy face toward the south  and drop  thy word  toward the south  and prophesy against the forest of the south field  
47	and say to the forest of the south  hear the word of the lord  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will kindle a fire in thee  and it shall devour every green tree in thee  and every dry tree  the flaming flame shall not be quenched  and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein  
48	and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it  it shall not be quenched  
49	then said i  ah lord god  they say of me  doth he not speak parables  
ezekiel 21
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face toward jerusalem  and drop  thy word  toward the holy places  and prophesy against the land of israel  
3	and say to the land of israel  thus saith the lord  behold  i  am  against thee  and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath  and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked  
4	seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked  therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north  
5	that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath  it shall not return any more  
6	sigh therefore  thou son of man  with the breaking of  thy  loins  and with bitterness sigh before their eyes  
7	and it shall be  when they say unto thee  wherefore sighest thou  that thou shalt answer  for the tidings  because it cometh  and every heart shall melt  and all hands shall be feeble  and every spirit shall faint  and all knees shall be weak  as  water  behold  it cometh  and shall be brought to pass  saith the lord god  
8 	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
9	son of man  prophesy  and say  thus saith the lord  say  a sword  a sword is sharpened  and also furbished  
10	it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter  it is furbished that it may glitter  should we then make mirth  it contemneth the rod of my son   as  every tree  
11	and he hath given it to be furbished  that it may be handled  this sword is sharpened  and it is furbished  to give it into the hand of the slayer  
12	cry and howl  son of man  for it shall be upon my people  it  shall be  upon all the princes of israel  terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people  smite therefore upon  thy  thigh  
13	because  it is  a trial  and what if  the sword  contemn even the rod  it shall be no  more   saith the lord god  
14	thou therefore  son of man  prophesy  and smite  thine  hands together  and let the sword be doubled the third time  the sword of the slain  it  is  the sword of the great  men that are  slain  which entereth into their privy chambers  
15	i have set the point of the sword against all their gates  that  their  heart may faint  and  their  ruins be multiplied  ah   it is  made bright   it is  wrapped up for the slaughter  
16	go thee one way or other   either  on the right hand   or  on the left  whithersoever thy face  is  set  
17	i will also smite mine hands together  and i will cause my fury to rest  i the lord have said  it   
18 	the word of the lord came unto me again  saying  
19	also  thou son of man  appoint thee two ways  that the sword of the king of babylon may come  both twain shall come forth out of one land  and choose thou a place  choose  it  at the head of the way to the city  
20	appoint a way  that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites  and to judah in jerusalem the defenced  
21	for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way  at the head of the two ways  to use divination  he made  his  arrows bright  he consulted with images  he looked in the liver  
22	at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem  to appoint captains  to open the mouth in the slaughter  to lift up the voice with shouting  to appoint  battering  rams against the gates  to cast a mount   and  to build a fort  
23	and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight  to them that have sworn oaths  but he will call to remembrance the iniquity  that they may be taken  
24	therefore thus saith the lord god  because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered  in that your transgressions are discovered  so that in all your doings your sins do appear  because   i say   that ye are come to remembrance  ye shall be taken with the hand  
25	and thou  profane wicked prince of israel  whose day is come  when iniquity  shall have  an end  
26	thus saith the lord god  remove the diadem  and take off the crown  this  shall  not  be  the same  exalt  him that is  low  and abase  him that is  high  
27	i will overturn  overturn  overturn  it  and it shall be no  more   until he come whose right it is  and i will give it  him   
28 	and thou  son of man  prophesy and say  thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites  and concerning their reproach  even say thou  the sword  the sword  is  drawn  for the slaughter  it is  furbished  to consume because of the glittering  
29	whiles they see vanity unto thee  whiles they divine a lie unto thee  to bring thee upon the necks of  them that are  slain  of the wicked  whose day is come  when their iniquity  shall have  an end  
30	shall i cause  it  to return into his sheath  i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created  in the land of thy nativity  
31	and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee  i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath  and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men   and  skilful to destroy  
32	thou shalt be for fuel to the fire  thy blood shall be in the midst of the land  thou shalt be no  more  remembered  for i the lord have spoken  it   
ezekiel 22
1 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	now  thou son of man  wilt thou judge  wilt thou judge the bloody city  yea  thou shalt shew her all her abominations  
3	then say thou  thus saith the lord god  the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it  that her time may come  and maketh idols against herself to defile herself  
4	thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed  and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made  and thou hast caused thy days to draw near  and art come  even  unto thy years  therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen  and a mocking to all countries  
5	 those that be  near  and  those that be  far from thee  shall mock thee   which art  infamous  and  much vexed  
6	behold  the princes of israel  every one were in thee to their power to shed blood  
7	in thee have they set light by father and mother  in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger  in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow  
8	thou hast despised mine holy things  and hast profaned my sabbaths  
9	in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood  and in thee they eat upon the mountains  in the midst of thee they commit lewdness  
10	in thee have they discovered their fathers  nakedness  in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution  
11	and one hath committed abomination with his neighbour s wife  and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law  and another in thee hath humbled his sister  his father s daughter  
12	in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood  thou hast taken usury and increase  and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion  and hast forgotten me  saith the lord god  
13	behold  therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made  and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee  
14	can thine heart endure  or can thine hands be strong  in the days that i shall deal with thee  i the lord have spoken  it   and will do  it   
15	and i will scatter thee among the heathen  and disperse thee in the countries  and will consume thy filthiness out of thee  
16	and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  
17 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
18	son of man  the house of israel is to me become dross  all they  are  brass  and tin  and iron  and lead  in the midst of the furnace  they are  even  the dross of silver  
19	therefore thus saith the lord god  because ye are all become dross  behold  therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem  
20	 as  they gather silver  and brass  and iron  and lead  and tin  into the midst of the furnace  to blow the fire upon it  to melt  it   so will i gather  you  in mine anger and in my fury  and i will leave  you there   and melt you  
21	yea  i will gather you  and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath  and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof  
22	as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace  so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof  and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you  
23 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
24	son of man  say unto her  thou  art  the land that is not cleansed  nor rained upon in the day of indignation  
25	 there is  a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof  like a roaring lion ravening the prey  they have devoured souls  they have taken the treasure and precious things  they have made her many widows in the midst thereof  
26	her priests have violated my law  and have profaned mine holy things  they have put no difference between the holy and profane  neither have they shewed  difference  between the unclean and the clean  and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths  and i am profaned among them  
27	her princes in the midst thereof  are  like wolves ravening the prey  to shed blood   and  to destroy souls  to get dishonest gain  
28	and her prophets have daubed them with untempered  morter   seeing vanity  and divining lies unto them  saying  thus saith the lord god  when the lord hath not spoken  
29	the people of the land have used oppression  and exercised robbery  and have vexed the poor and needy  yea  they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully  
30	and i sought for a man among them  that should make up the hedge  and stand in the gap before me for the land  that i should not destroy it  but i found none  
31	therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them  i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath  their own way have i recompensed upon their heads  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 23
1 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
2	son of man  there were two women  the daughters of one mother  
3	and they committed whoredoms in egypt  they committed whoredoms in their youth  there were their breasts pressed  and there they bruised the teats of their virginity  
4	and the names of them  were  aholah the elder  and aholibah her sister  and they were mine  and they bare sons and daughters  thus  were  their names  samaria  is  aholah  and jerusalem aholibah  
5	and aholah played the harlot when she was mine  and she doted on her lovers  on the assyrians  her  neighbours  
6	 which were  clothed with blue  captains and rulers  all of them desirable young men  horsemen riding upon horses  
7	thus she committed her whoredoms with them  with all them  that were  the chosen men of assyria  and with all on whom she doted  with all their idols she defiled herself  
8	neither left she her whoredoms  brought  from egypt  for in her youth they lay with her  and they bruised the breasts of her virginity  and poured their whoredom upon her  
9	wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers  into the hand of the assyrians  upon whom she doted  
10	these discovered her nakedness  they took her sons and her daughters  and slew her with the sword  and she became famous among women  for they had executed judgment upon her  
11 	and when her sister aholibah saw  this   she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she  and in her whoredoms more than her sister in  her  whoredoms  
12	she doted upon the assyrians  her  neighbours  captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously  horsemen riding upon horses  all of them desirable young men  
13	then i saw that she was defiled   that  they  took  both one way  
14	and  that  she increased her whoredoms  for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall  the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion  
15	girded with girdles upon their loins  exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads  all of them princes to look to  after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea  the land of their nativity  
16	and as soon as she saw them with her eyes  she doted upon them  and sent messengers unto them into chaldea  
17	and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love  and they defiled her with their whoredom  and she was polluted with them  and her mind was alienated from them  
18	so she discovered her whoredoms  and discovered her nakedness  then my mind was alienated from her  like as my mind was alienated from her sister  
19	yet she multiplied her whoredoms  in calling to remembrance the days of her youth  wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt  
20	for she doted upon their paramours  whose flesh  is as  the flesh of asses  and whose issue  is like  the issue of horses  
21	thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth  in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth  
22 	therefore  o aholibah  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will raise up thy lovers against thee  from whom thy mind is alienated  and i will bring them against thee on every side  
23	the babylonians  and all the chaldeans  pekod  and shoa  and koa   and  all the assyrians with them  all of them desirable young men  captains and rulers  great lords and renowned  all of them riding upon horses  
24	and they shall come against thee with chariots  wagons  and wheels  and with an assembly of people   which  shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about  and i will set judgment before them  and they shall judge thee according to their judgments  
25	and i will set my jealousy against thee  and they shall deal furiously with thee  they shall take away thy nose and thine ears  and thy remnant shall fall by the sword  they shall take thy sons and thy daughters  and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire  
26	they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes  and take away thy fair jewels  
27	thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee  and thy whoredom  brought  from the land of egypt  so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them  nor remember egypt any more  
28	for thus saith the lord god  behold  i will deliver thee into the hand  of them  whom thou hatest  into the hand  of them  from whom thy mind is alienated  
29	and they shall deal with thee hatefully  and shall take away all thy labour  and shall leave thee naked and bare  and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered  both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms  
30	i will do these  things  unto thee  because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen   and  because thou art polluted with their idols  
31	thou hast walked in the way of thy sister  therefore will i give her cup into thine hand  
32	thus saith the lord god  thou shalt drink of thy sister s cup deep and large  thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision  it containeth much  
33	thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow  with the cup of astonishment and desolation  with the cup of thy sister samaria  
34	thou shalt even drink it and suck  it  out  and thou shalt break the sherds thereof  and pluck off thine own breasts  for i have spoken  it   saith the lord god  
35	therefore thus saith the lord god  because thou hast forgotten me  and cast me behind thy back  therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms  
36 	the lord said moreover unto me  son of man  wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah  yea  declare unto them their abominations  
37	that they have committed adultery  and blood  is  in their hands  and with their idols have they committed adultery  and have also caused their sons  whom they bare unto me  to pass for them through  the fire   to devour  them   
38	moreover this they have done unto me  they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day  and have profaned my sabbaths  
39	for when they had slain their children to their idols  then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it  and  lo  thus have they done in the midst of mine house  
40	and furthermore  that ye have sent for men to come from far  unto whom a messenger  was  sent  and  lo  they came  for whom thou didst wash thyself  paintedst thy eyes  and deckedst thyself with ornaments  
41	and satest upon a stately bed  and a table prepared before it  whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil  
42	and a voice of a multitude being at ease  was  with her  and with the men of the common sort  were  brought sabeans from the wilderness  which put bracelets upon their hands  and beautiful crowns upon their heads  
43	then said i unto  her that was  old in adulteries  will they now commit whoredoms with her  and she  with them   
44	yet they went in unto her  as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot  so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah  the lewd women  
45	and the righteous men  they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses  and after the manner of women that shed blood  because they  are  adulteresses  and blood  is  in their hands  
46	for thus saith the lord god  i will bring up a company upon them  and will give them to be removed and spoiled  
47	and the company shall stone them with stones  and dispatch them with their swords  they shall slay their sons and their daughters  and burn up their houses with fire  
48	thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land  that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness  
49	and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you  and ye shall bear the sins of your idols  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord god  
ezekiel 24
1 	again in the ninth year  in the tenth month  in the tenth  day  of the month  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  write thee the name of the day   even  of this same day  the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day  
3	and utter a parable unto the rebellious house  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  set on a pot  set  it  on  and also pour water into it  
4	gather the pieces thereof into it   even  every good piece  the thigh  and the shoulder  fill  it  with the choice bones  
5	take the choice of the flock  and burn also the bones under it   and  make it boil well  and let them seethe the bones of it therein  
6	wherefore thus saith the lord god  woe to the bloody city  to the pot whose scum  is  therein  and whose scum is not gone out of it  bring it out piece by piece  let no lot fall upon it  
7	for her blood is in the midst of her  she set it upon the top of a rock  she poured it not upon the ground  to cover it with dust  
8	that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance  i have set her blood upon the top of a rock  that it should not be covered  
9	therefore thus saith the lord god  woe to the bloody city  i will even make the pile for fire great  
10	heap on wood  kindle the fire  consume the flesh  and spice it well  and let the bones be burned  
11	then set it empty upon the coals thereof  that the brass of it may be hot  and may burn  and  that  the filthiness of it may be molten in it   that  the scum of it may be consumed  
12	she hath wearied  herself  with lies  and her great scum went not forth out of her  her scum  shall be  in the fire  
13	in thy filthiness  is  lewdness  because i have purged thee  and thou wast not purged  thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more  till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee  
14	i the lord have spoken  it   it shall come to pass  and i will do  it   i will not go back  neither will i spare  neither will i repent  according to thy ways  and according to thy doings  shall they judge thee  saith the lord god  
15 	also the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
16	son of man  behold  i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke  yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep  neither shall thy tears run down  
17	forbear to cry  make no mourning for the dead  bind the tire of thine head upon thee  and put on thy shoes upon thy feet  and cover not  thy  lips  and eat not the bread of men  
18	so i spake unto the people in the morning  and at even my wife died  and i did in the morning as i was commanded  
19	and the people said unto me  wilt thou not tell us what these  things are  to us  that thou doest  so   
20	then i answered them  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
21	speak unto the house of israel  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will profane my sanctuary  the excellency of your strength  the desire of your eyes  and that which your soul pitieth  and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword  
22	and ye shall do as i have done  ye shall not cover  your  lips  nor eat the bread of men  
23	and your tires  shall be  upon your heads  and your shoes upon your feet  ye shall not mourn nor weep  but ye shall pine away for your iniquities  and mourn one toward another  
24	thus ezekiel is unto you a sign  according to all that he hath done shall ye do  and when this cometh  ye shall know that i  am  the lord god  
25	also  thou son of man   shall it  not  be  in the day when i take from them their strength  the joy of their glory  the desire of their eyes  and that whereupon they set their minds  their sons and their daughters  
26	 that  he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee  to cause  thee  to hear  it  with  thine  ears  
27	in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped  and thou shalt speak  and be no more dumb  and thou shalt be a sign unto them  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 25
1 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face against the ammonites  and prophesy against them  
3	and say unto the ammonites  hear the word of the lord god  thus saith the lord god  because thou saidst  aha  against my sanctuary  when it was profaned  and against the land of israel  when it was desolate  and against the house of judah  when they went into captivity  
4	behold  therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession  and they shall set their palaces in thee  and make their dwellings in thee  they shall eat thy fruit  and they shall drink thy milk  
5	and i will make rabbah a stable for camels  and the ammonites a couchingplace for flocks  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
6	for thus saith the lord god  because thou hast clapped  thine  hands  and stamped with the feet  and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel  
7	behold  therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee  and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen  and i will cut thee off from the people  and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries  i will destroy thee  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  
8 	thus saith the lord god  because that moab and seir do say  behold  the house of judah  is  like unto all the heathen  
9	therefore  behold  i will open the side of moab from the cities  from his cities  which are  on his frontiers  the glory of the country  bethjeshimoth  baalmeon  and kiriathaim  
10	unto the men of the east with the ammonites  and will give them in possession  that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations  
11	and i will execute judgments upon moab  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
12	thus saith the lord god  because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance  and hath greatly offended  and revenged himself upon them  
13	therefore thus saith the lord god  i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom  and will cut off man and beast from it  and i will make it desolate from teman  and they of dedan shall fall by the sword  
14	and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel  and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury  and they shall know my vengeance  saith the lord god  
15	thus saith the lord god  because the philistines have dealt by revenge  and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart  to destroy  it  for the old hatred  
16	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines  and i will cut off the cherethims  and destroy the remnant of the sea coast  
17	and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  when i shall lay my vengeance upon them  
ezekiel 26
1 	and it came to pass in the eleventh year  in the first  day  of the month   that  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem  aha  she is broken  that was  the gates of the people  she is turned unto me  i shall be replenished   now  she is laid waste  
3	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against thee  o tyrus  and will cause many nations to come up against thee  as the sea causeth his waves to come up  
4	and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus  and break down her towers  i will also scrape her dust from her  and make her like the top of a rock  
5	it shall be  a place for  the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea  for i have spoken  it   saith the lord god  and it shall become a spoil to the nations  
6	and her daughters which  are  in the field shall be slain by the sword  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
7	for thus saith the lord god  behold  i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  a king of kings  from the north  with horses  and with chariots  and with horsemen  and companies  and much people  
8	he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field  and he shall make a fort against thee  and cast a mount against thee  and lift up the buckler against thee  
9	and he shall set engines of war against thy walls  and with his axes he shall break down thy towers  
10	by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee  thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen  and of the wheels  and of the chariots  when he shall enter into thy gates  as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach  
11	with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets  he shall slay thy people by the sword  and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground  
12	and they shall make a spoil of thy riches  and make a prey of thy merchandise  and they shall break down thy walls  and destroy thy pleasant houses  and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water  
13	and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease  and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard  
14	and i will make thee like the top of a rock  thou shalt be  a place  to spread nets upon  thou shalt be built no more  for i the lord have spoken  it   saith the lord god  
15 	thus saith the lord god to tyrus  shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall  when the wounded cry  when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee  
16	then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones  and lay away their robes  and put off their broidered garments  they shall clothe themselves with trembling  they shall sit upon the ground  and shall tremble at  every  moment  and be astonished at thee  
17	and they shall take up a lamentation for thee  and say to thee  how art thou destroyed   that wast  inhabited of seafaring men  the renowned city  which wast strong in the sea  she and her inhabitants  which cause their terror  to be  on all that haunt it  
18	now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall  yea  the isles that  are  in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure  
19	for thus saith the lord god  when i shall make thee a desolate city  like the cities that are not inhabited  when i shall bring up the deep upon thee  and great waters shall cover thee  
20	when i shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit  with the people of old time  and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth  in places desolate of old  with them that go down to the pit  that thou be not inhabited  and i shall set glory in the land of the living  
21	i will make thee a terror  and thou  shalt be  no  more   though thou be sought for  yet shalt thou never be found again  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 27
1 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
2	now  thou son of man  take up a lamentation for tyrus  
3	and say unto tyrus  o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea   which art  a merchant of the people for many isles  thus saith the lord god  o tyrus  thou hast said  i  am  of perfect beauty

11	the men of arvad with thine army  were  upon thy walls round about  and the gammadims were in thy towers  they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about  they have made thy beauty perfect  
12	tarshish  was  thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all  kind of  riches  with silver  iron  tin  and lead  they traded in thy fairs  
13	javan  tubal  and meshech  they  were  thy merchants  they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market

26 	thy rowers have brought thee into great waters  the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas  
27	thy riches  and thy fairs  thy merchandise  thy mariners  and thy pilots  thy calkers  and the occupiers of thy merchandise  and all thy men of war  that  are  in thee  and in all thy company which  is  in the midst of thee  shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin

36	the merchants among the people shall hiss at thee  thou shalt be a terror  and never  shalt be  any more  
ezekiel 28
1 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
2	son of man  say unto the prince of tyrus  thus saith the lord god  because thine heart  is  lifted up  and thou hast said  i  am  a god  i sit  in  the seat of god  in the midst of the seas  yet thou  art  a man  and not god  though thou set thine heart as the heart of god  
3	behold  thou  art  wiser than daniel  there is no secret that they can hide from thee  
4	with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches  and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures  
5	by thy great wisdom  and  by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches  and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches  
6	therefore thus saith the lord god  because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god  
7	behold  therefore i will bring strangers upon thee  the terrible of the nations  and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom  and they shall defile thy brightness  
8	they shall bring thee down to the pit  and thou shalt die the deaths of  them that are  slain in the midst of the seas  
9	wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee  i  am  god  but thou  shalt be  a man  and no god  in the hand of him that slayeth thee  
10	thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers  for i have spoken  it   saith the lord god  
11 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
12	son of man  take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus  and say unto him  thus saith the lord god  thou sealest up the sum  full of wisdom  and perfect in beauty  
13	thou hast been in eden the garden of god  every precious stone  was  thy covering  the sardius  topaz  and the diamond  the beryl  the onyx  and the jasper  the sapphire  the emerald  and the carbuncle  and gold  the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created  
14	thou  art  the anointed cherub that covereth  and i have set thee  so   thou wast upon the holy mountain of god  thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire  
15	thou  wast  perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created  till iniquity was found in thee  
16	by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence  and thou hast sinned  therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god  and i will destroy thee  o covering cherub  from the midst of the stones of fire  
17	thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty  thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness  i will cast thee to the ground  i will lay thee before kings  that they may behold thee  
18	thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities  by the iniquity of thy traffick  therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee  it shall devour thee  and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee  
19	all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee  thou shalt be a terror  and never  shalt  thou  be  any more  
20 	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
21	son of man  set thy face against zidon  and prophesy against it  
22	and say  thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against thee  o zidon  and i will be glorified in the midst of thee  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  when i shall have executed judgments in her  and shall be sanctified in her  
23	for i will send into her pestilence  and blood into her streets  and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
24	and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel  nor  any  grieving thorn of all  that are  round about them  that despised them  and they shall know that i  am  the lord god  
25	thus saith the lord god  when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the people among whom they are scattered  and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen  then shall they dwell in their land that i have given to my servant jacob  
26	and they shall dwell safely therein  and shall build houses  and plant vineyards  yea  they shall dwell with confidence  when i have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them  and they shall know that i  am  the lord their god  
ezekiel 29
1 	in the tenth year  in the tenth  month   in the twelfth  day  of the month  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt  and prophesy against him  and against all egypt  
3	speak  and say  thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against thee  pharaoh king of egypt  the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers  which hath said  my river  is  mine own  and i have made  it  for myself  
4	but i will put hooks in thy jaws  and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales  and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers  and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales  
5	and i will leave thee  thrown  into the wilderness  thee and all the fish of thy rivers  thou shalt fall upon the open fields  thou shalt not be brought together  nor gathered  i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven  
6	and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i  am  the lord  because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel  
7	when they took hold of thee by thy hand  thou didst break  and rend all their shoulder  and when they leaned upon thee  thou brakest  and madest all their loins to be at a stand  
8 	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i will bring a sword upon thee  and cut off man and beast out of thee  
9	and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  because he hath said  the river  is  mine  and i have made  it   
10	behold  therefore i  am  against thee  and against thy rivers  and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste  and  desolate  from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia  
11	no foot of man shall pass through it  nor foot of beast shall pass through it  neither shall it be inhabited forty years  
12	and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries  that are  desolate  and her cities among the cities  that are  laid waste shall be desolate forty years  and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations  and will disperse them through the countries  
13	yet thus saith the lord god  at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered  
14	and i will bring again the captivity of egypt  and will cause them to return  into  the land of pathros  into the land of their habitation  and they shall be there a base kingdom  
15	it shall be the basest of the kingdoms  neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations  for i will diminish them  that they shall no more rule over the nations  
16	and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel  which bringeth  their  iniquity to remembrance  when they shall look after them  but they shall know that i  am  the lord god  
17 	and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year  in the first  month   in the first  day  of the month  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
18	son of man  nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus  every head  was  made bald  and every shoulder  was  peeled  yet had he no wages  nor his army  for tyrus  for the service that he had served against it  
19	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and he shall take her multitude  and take her spoil  and take her prey  and it shall be the wages for his army  
20	i have given him the land of egypt  for  his labour wherewith he served against it  because they wrought for me  saith the lord god  
21	in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth  and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 30
1 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
2	son of man  prophesy and say  thus saith the lord god  howl ye  woe worth the day  
3	for the day  is  near  even the day of the lord  is  near  a cloudy day  it shall be the time of the heathen  
4	and the sword shall come upon egypt  and great pain shall be in ethiopia  when the slain shall fall in egypt  and they shall take away her multitude  and her foundations shall be broken down  
5	ethiopia  and libya  and lydia  and all the mingled people  and chub  and the men of the land that is in league  shall fall with them by the sword  
6	thus saith the lord  they also that uphold egypt shall fall  and the pride of her power shall come down  from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword  saith the lord god  
7	and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries  that are  desolate  and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities  that are  wasted  
8	and they shall know that i  am  the lord  when i have set a fire in egypt  and  when  all her helpers shall be destroyed  
9	in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid  and great pain shall come upon them  as in the day of egypt  for  lo  it cometh  
10	thus saith the lord god  i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  
11	he and his people with him  the terrible of the nations  shall be brought to destroy the land  and they shall draw their swords against egypt  and fill the land with the slain  
12	and i will make the rivers dry  and sell the land into the hand of the wicked  and i will make the land waste  and all that is therein  by the hand of strangers  i the lord have spoken  it   
13	thus saith the lord god  i will also destroy the idols  and i will cause  their  images to cease out of noph  and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt  and i will put a fear in the land of egypt  
14	and i will make pathros desolate  and will set fire in zoan  and will execute judgments in no  
15	and i will pour my fury upon sin  the strength of egypt  and i will cut off the multitude of no  
16	and i will set fire in egypt  sin shall have great pain  and no shall be rent asunder  and noph  shall have  distresses daily  
17	the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword  and these  cities  shall go into captivity  
18	at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened  when i shall break there the yokes of egypt  and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her  as for her  a cloud shall cover her  and her daughters shall go into captivity  
19	thus will i execute judgments in egypt  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
20 	and it came to pass in the eleventh year  in the first  month   in the seventh  day  of the month   that  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
21	son of man  i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt  and  lo  it shall not be bound up to be healed  to put a roller to bind it  to make it strong to hold the sword  
22	therefore thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against pharaoh king of egypt  and will break his arms  the strong  and that which was broken  and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand  
23	and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations  and will disperse them through the countries  
24	and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon  and put my sword in his hand  but i will break pharaoh s arms  and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded  man   
25	but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon  and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt  
26	and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations  and disperse them among the countries  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 31
1 	and it came to pass in the eleventh year  in the third  month   in the first  day  of the month   that  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  speak unto pharaoh king of egypt  and to his multitude  whom art thou like in thy greatness  
3	behold  the assyrian  was  a cedar in lebanon with fair branches  and with a shadowing shroud  and of an high stature  and his top was among the thick boughs  
4	the waters made him great  the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants  and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field  
5	therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field  and his boughs were multiplied  and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters  when he shot forth  
6	all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs  and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young  and under his shadow dwelt all great nations  
7	thus was he fair in his greatness  in the length of his branches  for his root was by great waters  
8	the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him  the fir trees were not like his boughs  and the chesnut trees were not like his branches  nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his beauty  
9	i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches  so that all the trees of eden  that  were  in the garden of god  envied him  
10 	therefore thus saith the lord god  because thou hast lifted up thyself in height  and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs  and his heart is lifted up in his height  
11	i have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen  he shall surely deal with him  i have driven him out for his wickedness  
12	and strangers  the terrible of the nations  have cut him off  and have left him  upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen  and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land  and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow  and have left him  
13	upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain  and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches  
14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height  neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs  neither their trees stand up in their height  all that drink water  for they are all delivered unto death  to the nether parts of the earth  in the midst of the children of men  with them that go down to the pit  
15	thus saith the lord god  in the day when he went down to the grave i caused a mourning  i covered the deep for him  and i restrained the floods thereof  and the great waters were stayed  and i caused lebanon to mourn for him  and all the trees of the field fainted for him  
16	i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall  when i cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit  and all the trees of eden  the choice and best of lebanon  all that drink water  shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth  
17	they also went down into hell with him unto  them that be  slain with the sword  and  they that were  his arm   that  dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen  
18	to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden  yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth  thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with  them that be  slain by the sword  this  is  pharaoh and all his multitude  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 32
1 	and it came to pass in the twelfth year  in the twelfth month  in the first  day  of the month   that  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt  and say unto him  thou art like a young lion of the nations  and thou  art  as a whale in the seas  and thou camest forth with thy rivers  and troubledst the waters with thy feet  and fouledst their rivers  
3	thus saith the lord god  i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people  and they shall bring thee up in my net  
4	then will i leave thee upon the land  i will cast thee forth upon the open field  and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee  and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee  
5	and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains  and fill the valleys with thy height  
6	i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest   even  to the mountains  and the rivers shall be full of thee  
7	and when i shall put thee out  i will cover the heaven  and make the stars thereof dark  i will cover the sun with a cloud  and the moon shall not give her light  
8	all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee  and set darkness upon thy land  saith the lord god  
9	i will also vex the hearts of many people  when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations  into the countries which thou hast not known  
10	yea  i will make many people amazed at thee  and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee  when i shall brandish my sword before them  and they shall tremble at  every  moment  every man for his own life  in the day of thy fall  
11	for thus saith the lord god  the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee  
12	by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall  the terrible of the nations  all of them  and they shall spoil the pomp of egypt  and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed  
13	i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters  neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more  nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them  
14	then will i make their waters deep  and cause their rivers to run like oil  saith the lord god  
15	when i shall make the land of egypt desolate  and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full  when i shall smite all them that dwell therein  then shall they know that i  am  the lord  
16	this  is  the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her  the daughters of the nations shall lament her  they shall lament for her   even  for egypt  and for all her multitude  saith the lord god  
17 	it came to pass also in the twelfth year  in the fifteenth  day  of the month   that  the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
18	son of man  wail for the multitude of egypt  and cast them down   even  her  and the daughters of the famous nations  unto the nether parts of the earth  with them that go down into the pit  
19	whom dost thou pass in beauty  go down  and be thou laid with the uncircumcised  
20	they shall fall in the midst of  them that are  slain by the sword  she is delivered to the sword  draw her and all her multitudes  
21	the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him  they are gone down  they lie uncircumcised  slain by the sword  
22	asshur  is  there and all her company  his graves  are  about him  all of them slain  fallen by the sword  
23	whose graves are set in the sides of the pit  and her company is round about her grave  all of them slain  fallen by the sword  which caused terror in the land of the living  
24	there  is  elam and all her multitude round about her grave  all of them slain  fallen by the sword  which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth  which caused their terror in the land of the living  yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit  
25	they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude  her graves  are  round about him  all of them uncircumcised  slain by the sword  though their terror was caused in the land of the living  yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit  he is put in the midst of  them that be  slain  
26	there  is  meshech  tubal  and all her multitude  her graves  are  round about him  all of them uncircumcised  slain by the sword  though they caused their terror in the land of the living  
27	and they shall not lie with the mighty  that are  fallen of the uncircumcised  which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war  and they have laid their swords under their heads  but their iniquities shall be upon their bones  though  they were  the terror of the mighty in the land of the living  
28	yea  thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised  and shalt lie with  them that are  slain with the sword  
29	there  is  edom  her kings  and all her princes  which with their might are laid by  them that were  slain by the sword  they shall lie with the uncircumcised  and with them that go down to the pit  
30	there  be  the princes of the north  all of them  and all the zidonians  which are gone down with the slain  with their terror they are ashamed of their might  and they lie uncircumcised with  them that be  slain by the sword  and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit  
31	pharaoh shall see them  and shall be comforted over all his multitude   even  pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword  saith the lord god  
32	for i have caused my terror in the land of the living  and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with  them that are  slain with the sword   even  pharaoh and all his multitude  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 33
1 	again the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  speak to the children of thy people  and say unto them  when i bring the sword upon a land  if the people of the land take a man of their coasts  and set him for their watchman  
3	if when he seeth the sword come upon the land  he blow the trumpet  and warn the people  
4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet  and taketh not warning  if the sword come  and take him away  his blood shall be upon his own head  
5	he heard the sound of the trumpet  and took not warning  his blood shall be upon him  but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul  
6	but if the watchman see the sword come  and blow not the trumpet  and the people be not warned  if the sword come  and take  any  person from among them  he is taken away in his iniquity  but his blood will i require at the watchman s hand  
7	so thou  o son of man  i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel  therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth  and warn them from me  
8	when i say unto the wicked  o wicked  man   thou shalt surely die  if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way  that wicked  man  shall die in his iniquity  but his blood will i require at thine hand  
9	nevertheless  if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it  if he do not turn from his way  he shall die in his iniquity  but thou hast delivered thy soul  
10 	therefore  o thou son of man  speak unto the house of israel  thus ye speak  saying  if our transgressions and our sins  be  upon us  and we pine away in them  how should we then live  
11	say unto them   as  i live  saith the lord god  i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked  but that the wicked turn from his way and live  turn ye  turn ye from your evil ways  for why will ye die  o house of israel  
12	therefore  thou son of man  say unto the children of thy people  the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression  as for the wickedness of the wicked  he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness  neither shall the righteous be able to live for his  righteousness  in the day that he sinneth  
13	when i shall say to the righteous   that  he shall surely live  if he trust to his own righteousness  and commit iniquity  all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered  but for his iniquity that he hath committed  he shall die for it  
14	again  when i say unto the wicked  thou shalt surely die  if he turn from his sin  and do that which is lawful and right  
15	 if  the wicked restore the pledge  give again that he had robbed  walk in the statutes of life  without committing iniquity  he shall surely live  he shall not die  
16	none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him  he hath done that which is lawful and right  he shall surely live  
17	yet the children of thy people say  the way of the lord is not equal  but as for them  their way is not equal  
18	when the righteous turneth from his righteousness  and committeth iniquity  he shall even die thereby  
19	but if the wicked turn from his wickedness  and do that which is lawful and right  he shall live thereby  
20	yet ye say  the way of the lord is not equal  o ye house of israel  i will judge you every one after his ways  
21 	and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity  in the tenth  month   in the fifth  day  of the month   that  one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me  saying  the city is smitten  
22	now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening  afore he that was escaped came  and had opened my mouth  until he came to me in the morning  and my mouth was opened  and i was no more dumb  
23	then the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
24	son of man  they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak  saying  abraham was one  and he inherited the land  but we  are  many  the land is given us for inheritance  
25	wherefore say unto them  thus saith the lord god  ye eat with the blood  and lift up your eyes toward your idols  and shed blood  and shall ye possess the land  
26	ye stand upon your sword  ye work abomination  and ye defile every one his neighbour s wife  and shall ye possess the land  
27	say thou thus unto them  thus saith the lord god   as  i live  surely they that  are  in the wastes shall fall by the sword  and him that  is  in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured  and they that  be  in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence  
28	for i will lay the land most desolate  and the pomp of her strength shall cease  and the mountains of israel shall be desolate  that none shall pass through  
29	then shall they know that i  am  the lord  when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed  
30 	also  thou son of man  the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses  and speak one to another  every one to his brother  saying  come  i pray you  and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord  
31	and they come unto thee as the people cometh  and they sit before thee  as  my people  and they hear thy words  but they will not do them  for with their mouth they shew much love   but  their heart goeth after their covetousness  
32	and  lo  thou  art  unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice  and can play well on an instrument  for they hear thy words  but they do them not  
33	and when this cometh to pass   lo  it will come   then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them  
ezekiel 34
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  prophesy against the shepherds of israel  prophesy  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds  woe  be  to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves  should not the shepherds feed the flocks  
3	ye eat the fat  and ye clothe you with the wool  ye kill them that are fed   but  ye feed not the flock  
4	the diseased have ye not strengthened  neither have ye healed that which was sick  neither have ye bound up  that which was  broken  neither have ye brought again that which was driven away  neither have ye sought that which was lost  but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them  
5	and they were scattered  because  there is  no shepherd  and they became meat to all the beasts of the field  when they were scattered  
6	my sheep wandered through all the mountains  and upon every high hill  yea  my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth  and none did search or seek  after them   
7 	therefore  ye shepherds  hear the word of the lord  
8	 as  i live  saith the lord god  surely because my flock became a prey  and my flock became meat to every beast of the field  because  there was  no shepherd  neither did my shepherds search for my flock  but the shepherds fed themselves  and fed not my flock  
9	therefore  o ye shepherds  hear the word of the lord  
10	thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against the shepherds  and i will require my flock at their hand  and cause them to cease from feeding the flock  neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more  for i will deliver my flock from their mouth  that they may not be meat for them  
11	for thus saith the lord god  behold  i   even  i  will both search my sheep  and seek them out  
12	as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep  that are  scattered  so will i seek out my sheep  and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day  
13	and i will bring them out from the people  and gather them from the countries  and will bring them to their own land  and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers  and in all the inhabited places of the country  
14	i will feed them in a good pasture  and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be  there shall they lie in a good fold  and  in  a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel  
15	i will feed my flock  and i will cause them to lie down  saith the lord god  
16	i will seek that which was lost  and bring again that which was driven away  and will bind up  that which was  broken  and will strengthen that which was sick  but i will destroy the fat and the strong  i will feed them with judgment  
17 	and  as for  you  o my flock  thus saith the lord god  behold  i judge between cattle and cattle  between the rams and the he goats  
18	 seemeth it  a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture  but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures  and to have drunk of the deep waters  but ye must foul the residue with your feet  
19	and  as for  my flock  they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet  and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet  
20	therefore thus saith the lord god unto them  behold  i   even  i  will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle  
21	because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder  and pushed all the diseased with your horns  till ye have scattered them abroad  
22	therefore will i save my flock  and they shall no more be a prey  and i will judge between cattle and cattle  
23	and i will set up one shepherd over them  and he shall feed them   even  my servant david  he shall feed them  and he shall be their shepherd  
24	and i the lord will be their god  and my servant david a prince among them  i the lord have spoken  it   
25	and i will make with them a covenant of peace  and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land  and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness  and sleep in the woods  
26	and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing  and i will cause the shower to come down in his season  there shall be showers of blessing  
27	and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit  and the earth shall yield her increase  and they shall be safe in their land  and shall know that i  am  the lord  when i have broken the bands of their yoke  and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them  
28	and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen  neither shall the beast of the land devour them  but they shall dwell safely  and none shall make  them  afraid  
29	and i will raise up for them a plant of renown  and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land  neither bear the shame of the heathen any more  
30	thus shall they know that i the lord their god  am  with them  and  that  they   even  the house of israel   are  my people  saith the lord god  
31	and ye my flock  the flock of my pasture   are  men   and  i  am  your god  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 35
1 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face against mount seir  and prophesy against it  
3	and say unto it  thus saith the lord god  behold  o mount seir  i  am  against thee  and i will stretch out mine hand against thee  and i will make thee most desolate  
4	i will lay thy cities waste  and thou shalt be desolate  and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord  
5	because thou hast had a perpetual hatred  and hast shed  the blood of  the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity  in the time  that their  iniquity  had  an end  
6	therefore   as  i live  saith the lord god  i will prepare thee unto blood  and blood shall pursue thee  sith thou hast not hated blood  even blood shall pursue thee  
7	thus will i make mount seir most desolate  and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth  
8	and i will fill his mountains with his slain  men   in thy hills  and in thy valleys  and in all thy rivers  shall they fall that are slain with the sword  
9	i will make thee perpetual desolations  and thy cities shall not return  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
10 	because thou hast said  these two nations and these two countries shall be mine  and we will possess it  whereas the lord was there  
11	therefore   as  i live  saith the lord god  i will even do according to thine anger  and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them  and i will make myself known among them  when i have judged thee  
12	and thou shalt know that i  am  the lord   and that  i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel  saying  they are laid desolate  they are given us to consume  
13	thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me  and have multiplied your words against me  i have heard  them   
14	thus saith the lord god  when the whole earth rejoiceth  i will make thee desolate  
15	as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel  because it was desolate  so will i do unto thee  thou shalt be desolate  o mount seir  and all idumea   even  all of it  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 36
1 	also  thou son of man  prophesy unto the mountains of israel  and say  ye mountains of israel  hear the word of the lord  
2	thus saith the lord god  because the enemy hath said against you  aha  even the ancient high places are ours in possession  
3	therefore prophesy and say  thus saith the lord god  because they have made  you  desolate  and swallowed you up on every side  that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen  and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers  and  are  an infamy of the people  
4	therefore  ye mountains of israel  hear the word of the lord god  thus saith the lord god to the mountains  and to the hills  to the rivers  and to the valleys  to the desolate wastes  and to the cities that are forsaken  which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that  are  round about  
5	therefore thus saith the lord god  surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen  and against all idumea  which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all  their  heart  with despiteful minds  to cast it out for a prey  
6	prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel  and say unto the mountains  and to the hills  to the rivers  and to the valleys  thus saith the lord god  behold  i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury  because ye have borne the shame of the heathen  
7	therefore thus saith the lord god  i have lifted up mine hand  surely the heathen that  are  about you  they shall bear their shame  
8	but ye  o mountains of israel  ye shall shoot forth your branches  and yield your fruit to my people of israel  for they are at hand to come  
9	for  behold  i  am  for you  and i will turn unto you  and ye shall be tilled and sown  
10	and i will multiply men upon you  all the house of israel   even  all of it  and the cities shall be inhabited  and the wastes shall be builded  
11	and i will multiply upon you man and beast  and they shall increase and bring fruit  and i will settle you after your old estates  and will do better  unto you  than at your beginnings  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
12	yea  i will cause men to walk upon you   even  my people israel  and they shall possess thee  and thou shalt be their inheritance  and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them  of men   
13	thus saith the lord god  because they say unto you  thou  land  devourest up men  and hast bereaved thy nations  
14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more  neither bereave thy nations any more  saith the lord god  
15	neither will i cause  men  to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more  neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more  neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more  saith the lord god  
16 	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
17	son of man  when the house of israel dwelt in their own land  they defiled it by their own way and by their doings  their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman  
18	wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land  and for their idols  wherewith  they had polluted it  
19	and i scattered them among the heathen  and they were dispersed through the countries  according to their way and according to their doings i judged them  
20	and when they entered unto the heathen  whither they went  they profaned my holy name  when they said to them  these  are  the people of the lord  and are gone forth out of his land  
21	but i had pity for mine holy name  which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen  whither they went  
22	therefore say unto the house of israel  thus saith the lord god  i do not  this  for your sakes  o house of israel  but for mine holy name s sake  which ye have profaned among the heathen  whither ye went  
23	and i will sanctify my great name  which was profaned among the heathen  which ye have profaned in the midst of them  and the heathen shall know that i  am  the lord  saith the lord god  when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes  
24	for i will take you from among the heathen  and gather you out of all countries  and will bring you into your own land  
25 	then will i sprinkle clean water upon you  and ye shall be clean  from all your filthiness  and from all your idols  will i cleanse you  
26	a new heart also will i give you  and a new spirit will i put within you  and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh  and i will give you an heart of flesh  
27	and i will put my spirit within you  and cause you to walk in my statutes  and ye shall keep my judgments  and do  them   
28	and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers  and ye shall be my people  and i will be your god  
29	i will also save you from all your uncleannesses  and i will call for the corn  and will increase it  and lay no famine upon you  
30	and i will multiply the fruit of the tree  and the increase of the field  that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen  
31	then shall ye remember your own evil ways  and your doings that  were  not good  and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations  
32	not for your sakes do i  this   saith the lord god  be it known unto you  be ashamed and confounded for your own ways  o house of israel  
33	thus saith the lord god  in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause  you  to dwell in the cities  and the wastes shall be builded  
34	and the desolate land shall be tilled  whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by  
35	and they shall say  this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden  and the waste and desolate and ruined cities  are become  fenced   and  are inhabited  
36	then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined  places  and  plant that that was desolate  i the lord have spoken  it   and i will do  it   
37	thus saith the lord god  i will yet  for  this be enquired of by the house of israel  to do  it  for them  i will increase them with men like a flock  
38	as the holy flock  as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts  so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 37
1 	the hand of the lord was upon me  and carried me out in the spirit of the lord  and set me down in the midst of the valley which  was  full of bones  
2	and caused me to pass by them round about  and  behold   there were  very many in the open valley  and  lo   they were  very dry  
3	and he said unto me  son of man  can these bones live  and i answered  o lord god  thou knowest  
4	again he said unto me  prophesy upon these bones  and say unto them  o ye dry bones  hear the word of the lord  
5	thus saith the lord god unto these bones  behold  i will cause breath to enter into you  and ye shall live  
6	and i will lay sinews upon you  and will bring up flesh upon you  and cover you with skin  and put breath in you  and ye shall live  and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  
7	so i prophesied as i was commanded  and as i prophesied  there was a noise  and behold a shaking  and the bones came together  bone to his bone  
8	and when i beheld  lo  the sinews and the flesh came up upon them  and the skin covered them above  but  there was  no breath in them  
9	then said he unto me  prophesy unto the wind  prophesy  son of man  and say to the wind  thus saith the lord god  come from the four winds  o breath  and breathe upon these slain  that they may live  
10	so i prophesied as he commanded me  and the breath came into them  and they lived  and stood up upon their feet  an exceeding great army  
11	then he said unto me  son of man  these bones are the whole house of israel  behold  they say  our bones are dried  and our hope is lost  we are cut off for our parts  
12	therefore prophesy and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  behold  o my people  i will open your graves  and cause you to come up out of your graves  and bring you into the land of israel  
13	and ye shall know that i  am  the lord  when i have opened your graves  o my people  and brought you up out of your graves  
14	and shall put my spirit in you  and ye shall live  and i shall place you in your own land  then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken  it   and performed  it   saith the lord  
15 	the word of the lord came again unto me  saying  
16	moreover  thou son of man  take thee one stick  and write upon it  for judah  and for the children of israel his companions  then take another stick  and write upon it  for joseph  the stick of ephraim  and  for  all the house of israel his companions  
17	and join them one to another into one stick  and they shall become one in thine hand  
18	and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee  saying  wilt thou not shew us what thou  meanest  by these  
19	say unto them  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will take the stick of joseph  which  is  in the hand of ephraim  and the tribes of israel his fellows  and will put them with him   even  with the stick of judah  and make them one stick  and they shall be one in mine hand  
20	and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes  
21	and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will take the children of israel from among the heathen  whither they be gone  and will gather them on every side  and bring them into their own land  
22	and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel  and one king shall be king to them all  and they shall be no more two nations  neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all  
23	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols  nor with their detestable things  nor with any of their transgressions  but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces  wherein they have sinned  and will cleanse them  so shall they be my people  and i will be their god  
24	and david my servant  shall be  king over them  and they all shall have one shepherd  they shall also walk in my judgments  and observe my statutes  and do them  
25	and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant  wherein your fathers have dwelt  and they shall dwell therein   even  they  and their children  and their children s children for ever  and my servant david  shall be  their prince for ever  
26	moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them  it shall be an everlasting covenant with them  and i will place them  and multiply them  and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore  
27	my tabernacle also shall be with them  yea  i will be their god  and they shall be my people  
28	and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel  when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore  
ezekiel 38
1 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
2	son of man  set thy face against gog  the land of magog  the chief prince of meshech and tubal  and prophesy against him  
3	and say  thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against thee  o gog  the chief prince of meshech and tubal  
4	and i will turn thee back  and put hooks into thy jaws  and i will bring thee forth  and all thine army  horses and horsemen  all of them clothed with all sorts  of armour  even  a great company  with  bucklers and shields  all of them handling swords  
5	persia  ethiopia  and libya with them  all of them with shield and helmet  
6	gomer  and all his bands  the house of togarmah of the north quarters  and all his bands   and  many people with thee  
7	be thou prepared  and prepare for thyself  thou  and all thy company that are assembled unto thee  and be thou a guard unto them  
8	after many days thou shalt be visited  in the latter years thou shalt come into the land  that is  brought back from the sword   and is  gathered out of many people  against the mountains of israel  which have been always waste  but it is brought forth out of the nations  and they shall dwell safely all of them  
9	thou shalt ascend and come like a storm  thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land  thou  and all thy bands  and many people with thee  
10	thus saith the lord god  it shall also come to pass   that  at the same time shall things come into thy mind  and thou shalt think an evil thought  
11	and thou shalt say  i will go up to the land of unwalled villages  i will go to them that are at rest  that dwell safely  all of them dwelling without walls  and having neither bars nor gates  
12	to take a spoil  and to take a prey  to turn thine hand upon the desolate places  that are now  inhabited  and upon the people  that are  gathered out of the nations  which have gotten cattle and goods  that dwell in the midst of the land  
13	sheba  and dedan  and the merchants of tarshish  with all the young lions thereof  shall say unto thee  art thou come to take a spoil  hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey  to carry away silver and gold  to take away cattle and goods  to take a great spoil  
14 	therefore  son of man  prophesy and say unto gog  thus saith the lord god  in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely  shalt thou not know  it   
15	and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts  thou  and many people with thee  all of them riding upon horses  a great company  and a mighty army  
16	and thou shalt come up against my people of israel  as a cloud to cover the land  it shall be in the latter days  and i will bring thee against my land  that the heathen may know me  when i shall be sanctified in thee  o gog  before their eyes  
17	thus saith the lord god   art  thou he of whom i have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of israel  which prophesied in those days  many  years that i would bring thee against them  
18	and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel  saith the lord god   that  my fury shall come up in my face  
19	for in my jealousy  and  in the fire of my wrath have i spoken  surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel  
20	so that the fishes of the sea  and the fowls of the heaven  and the beasts of the field  and all creeping things that creep upon the earth  and all the men that  are  upon the face of the earth  shall shake at my presence  and the mountains shall be thrown down  and the steep places shall fall  and every wall shall fall to the ground  
21	and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains  saith the lord god  every man s sword shall be against his brother  
22	and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood  and i will rain upon him  and upon his bands  and upon the many people that  are  with him  an overflowing rain  and great hailstones  fire  and brimstone  
23	thus will i magnify myself  and sanctify myself  and i will be known in the eyes of many nations  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
ezekiel 39
1 	therefore  thou son of man  prophesy against gog  and say  thus saith the lord god  behold  i  am  against thee  o gog  the chief prince of meshech and tubal  
2	and i will turn thee back  and leave but the sixth part of thee  and will cause thee to come up from the north parts  and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel  
3	and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand  and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand  
4	thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel  thou  and all thy bands  and the people that  is  with thee  i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort  and  to  the beasts of the field to be devoured  
5	thou shalt fall upon the open field  for i have spoken  it   saith the lord god  
6	and i will send a fire on magog  and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles  and they shall know that i  am  the lord  
7	so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people israel  and i will not  let them  pollute my holy name any more  and the heathen shall know that i  am  the lord  the holy one in israel  
8 	behold  it is come  and it is done  saith the lord god  this  is  the day whereof i have spoken  
9	and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth  and shall set on fire and burn the weapons  both the shields and the bucklers  the bows and the arrows  and the handstaves  and the spears  and they shall burn them with fire seven years  
10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field  neither cut down  any  out of the forests  for they shall burn the weapons with fire  and they shall spoil those that spoiled them  and rob those that robbed them  saith the lord god  
11	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  i will give unto gog a place there of graves in israel  the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea  and it shall stop the  noses  of the passengers  and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude  and they shall call  it  the valley of hamongog  
12	and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them  that they may cleanse the land  
13	yea  all the people of the land shall bury  them   and it shall be to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified  saith the lord god  
14	and they shall sever out men of continual employment  passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth  to cleanse it  after the end of seven months shall they search  
15	and the passengers  that  pass through the land  when  any  seeth a man s bone  then shall he set up a sign by it  till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog  
16	and also the name of the city  shall be  hamonah  thus shall they cleanse the land  
17	and  thou son of man  thus saith the lord god  speak unto every feathered fowl  and to every beast of the field  assemble yourselves  and come  gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you   even  a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel  that ye may eat flesh  and drink blood  
18	ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty  and drink the blood of the princes of the earth  of rams  of lambs  and of goats  of bullocks  all of them fatlings of bashan  
19	and ye shall eat fat till ye be full  and drink blood till ye be drunken  of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you  
20	thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots  with mighty men  and with all men of war  saith the lord god  
21	and i will set my glory among the heathen  and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have executed  and my hand that i have laid upon them  
22	so the house of israel shall know that i  am  the lord their god from that day and forward  
23 	and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity  because they trespassed against me  therefore hid i my face from them  and gave them into the hand of their enemies  so fell they all by the sword  
24	according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have i done unto them  and hid my face from them  
25	therefore thus saith the lord god  now will i bring again the captivity of jacob  and have mercy upon the whole house of israel  and will be jealous for my holy name  
26	after that they have borne their shame  and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me  when they dwelt safely in their land  and none made  them  afraid  
27	when i have brought them again from the people  and gathered them out of their enemies  lands  and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations  
28	then shall they know that i  am  the lord their god  which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen  but i have gathered them unto their own land  and have left none of them any more there  
29	neither will i hide my face any more from them  for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel  saith the lord god

7	and  there was  an enlarging  and a winding about still upward to the side chambers  for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house  therefore the breadth of the house  was still  upward  and so increased  from  the lowest  chamber  to the highest by the midst  
8	i saw also the height of the house round about  the foundations of the side chambers  were  a full reed of six great cubits  
9	the thickness of the wall  which  was  for the side chamber without   was  five cubits  and  that  which  was  left  was  the place of the side chambers that  were  within

4	and before the chambers  was  a walk of ten cubits breadth inward  a way of one cubit  and their doors toward the north  
5	now the upper chambers  were  shorter  for the galleries were higher than these  than the lower  and than the middlemost of the building  
6	for they  were  in three  stories   but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts  therefore  the building  was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground  
7	and the wall that  was  without over against the chambers  toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers  the length thereof  was  fifty cubits  
8	for the length of the chambers that  were  in the utter court  was  fifty cubits  and  lo  before the temple  were  an hundred cubits

11	and the way before them  was  like the appearance of the chambers which  were  toward the north  as long as they   and  as broad as they  and all their goings out  were  both according to their fashions  and according to their doors  
12	and according to the doors of the chambers that  were  toward the south  was  a door in the head of the way   even  the way directly before the wall toward the east  as one entereth into them  
13	then said he unto me  the north chambers  and  the south chambers  which  are  before the separate place  they  be  holy chambers  where the priests that approach unto the lord shall eat the most holy things  there shall they lay the most holy things  and the meat offering  and the sin offering  and the trespass offering  for the place  is  holy  
14	when the priests enter therein  then shall they not go out of the holy  place  into the utter court  but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister  for they  are  holy  and shall put on other garments  and shall approach to  those things  which  are  for the people  
15 	now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house  he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect  is  toward the east  and measured it round about

ezekiel 43
1 	afterward he brought me to the gate   even  the gate that looketh toward the east  
2	and  behold  the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east  and his voice  was  like a noise of many waters  and the earth shined with his glory  
3	and  it was  according to the appearance of the vision which i saw   even  according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city  and the visions  were  like the vision that i saw by the river chebar  and i fell upon my face  
4	and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect  is  toward the east  
5	so the spirit took me up  and brought me into the inner court  and  behold  the glory of the lord filled the house  
6	and i heard  him  speaking unto me out of the house  and the man stood by me  
7 	and he said unto me  son of man  the place of my throne  and the place of the soles of my feet  where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever  and my holy name  shall the house of israel no more defile   neither  they  nor their kings  by their whoredom  nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places  
8	in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds  and their post by my posts  and the wall between me and them  they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed  wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger  
9	now let them put away their whoredom  and the carcases of their kings  far from me  and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever  
10	thou son of man  shew the house to the house of israel  that they may be ashamed of their iniquities  and let them measure the pattern  
11	and if they be ashamed of all that they have done  shew them the form of the house  and the fashion thereof  and the goings out thereof  and the comings in thereof  and all the forms thereof  and all the ordinances thereof  and all the forms thereof  and all the laws thereof  and write  it  in their sight  that they may keep the whole form thereof  and all the ordinances thereof  and do them  
12	this  is  the law of the house  upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about  shall be  most holy  behold  this  is  the law of the house  
13 	and these  are  the measures of the altar after the cubits  the cubit  is  a cubit and an hand breadth  even the bottom  shall be  a cubit  and the breadth a cubit  and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about  shall be  a span  and this  shall be  the higher place of the altar  
14	and from the bottom  upon  the ground  even  to the lower settle  shall be  two cubits  and the breadth one cubit  and from the lesser settle  even  to the greater settle  shall be  four cubits  and the breadth  one  cubit  
15	so the altar  shall be  four cubits  and from the altar and upward  shall be  four horns  
16	and the altar  shall be  twelve  cubits  long  twelve broad  square in the four squares thereof  
17	and the settle  shall be  fourteen  cubits  long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof  and the border about it  shall be  half a cubit  and the bottom thereof  shall be  a cubit about  and his stairs shall look toward the east  
18	and he said unto me  son of man  thus saith the lord god  these  are  the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it  to offer burnt offerings thereon  and to sprinkle blood thereon  
19	and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok  which approach unto me  to minister unto me  saith the lord god  a young bullock for a sin offering  
20	and thou shalt take of the blood thereof  and put  it  on the four horns of it  and on the four corners of the settle  and upon the border round about  thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it  
21	thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering  and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house  without the sanctuary  
22	and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering  and they shall cleanse the altar  as they did cleanse  it  with the bullock  
23	when thou hast made an end of cleansing  it   thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish  and a ram out of the flock without blemish  
24	and thou shalt offer them before the lord  and the priests shall cast salt upon them  and they shall offer them up  for  a burnt offering unto the lord  
25	seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat  for  a sin offering  they shall also prepare a young bullock  and a ram out of the flock  without blemish  
26	seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it  and they shall consecrate themselves  
27	and when these days are expired  it shall be   that  upon the eighth day  and  so  forward  the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar  and your peace offerings  and i will accept you  saith the lord god  
ezekiel 44
1 	then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east  and it  was  shut  
2	then said the lord unto me  this gate shall be shut  it shall not be opened  and no man shall enter in by it  because the lord  the god of israel  hath entered in by it  therefore it shall be shut  
3	 it is  for the prince  the prince  he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord  he shall enter by the way of the porch of  that  gate  and shall go out by the way of the same  
4 	then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house  and i looked  and  behold  the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord  and i fell upon my face  
5	and the lord said unto me  son of man  mark well  and behold with thine eyes  and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord  and all the laws thereof  and mark well the entering in of the house  with every going forth of the sanctuary  
6	and thou shalt say to the rebellious   even  to the house of israel  thus saith the lord god  o ye house of israel  let it suffice you of all your abominations  
7	in that ye have brought  into my sanctuary  strangers  uncircumcised in heart  and uncircumcised in flesh  to be in my sanctuary  to pollute it   even  my house  when ye offer my bread  the fat and the blood  and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations  
8	and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things  but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves  
9	thus saith the lord god  no stranger  uncircumcised in heart  nor uncircumcised in flesh  shall enter into my sanctuary  of any stranger that  is  among the children of israel  
10 	and the levites that are gone away far from me  when israel went astray  which went astray away from me after their idols  they shall even bear their iniquity  
11	yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary   having  charge at the gates of the house  and ministering to the house  they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people  and they shall stand before them to minister unto them  
12	because they ministered unto them before their idols  and caused the house of israel to fall into iniquity  therefore have i lifted up mine hand against them  saith the lord god  and they shall bear their iniquity  
13	and they shall not come near unto me  to do the office of a priest unto me  nor to come near to any of my holy things  in the most holy  place   but they shall bear their shame  and their abominations which they have committed  
14	but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house  for all the service thereof  and for all that shall be done therein  
15	but the priests the levites  the sons of zadok  that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me  they shall come near to me to minister unto me  and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood  saith the lord god  
16	they shall enter into my sanctuary  and they shall come near to my table  to minister unto me  and they shall keep my charge  
17 	and it shall come to pass   that  when they enter in at the gates of the inner court  they shall be clothed with linen garments  and no wool shall come upon them  whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court  and within  
18	they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads  and shall have linen breeches upon their loins  they shall not gird  themselves  with any thing that causeth sweat  
19	and when they go forth into the utter court   even  into the utter court to the people  they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered  and lay them in the holy chambers  and they shall put on other garments  and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments  
20	neither shall they shave their heads  nor suffer their locks to grow long  they shall only poll their heads  
21	neither shall any priest drink wine  when they enter into the inner court  
22	neither shall they take for their wives a widow  nor her that is put away  but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of israel  or a widow that had a priest before  
23	and they shall teach my people  the difference  between the holy and profane  and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean  
24	and in controversy they shall stand in judgment   and  they shall judge it according to my judgments  and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies  and they shall hallow my sabbaths  
25	and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves  but for father  or for mother  or for son  or for daughter  for brother  or for sister that hath had no husband  they may defile themselves  
26	and after he is cleansed  they shall reckon unto him seven days  
27	and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary  unto the inner court  to minister in the sanctuary  he shall offer his sin offering  saith the lord god  
28	and it shall be unto them for an inheritance  i  am  their inheritance  and ye shall give them no possession in israel  i  am  their possession  
29	they shall eat the meat offering  and the sin offering  and the trespass offering  and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs  
30	and the first of all the firstfruits of all  things   and every oblation of all  of every  sort  of your oblations  shall be the priest s  ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough  that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house  
31	the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself  or torn  whether it be fowl or beast  
ezekiel 45
1 	moreover  when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance  ye shall offer an oblation unto the lord  an holy portion of the land  the length  shall be  the length of five and twenty thousand  reeds   and the breadth  shall be  ten thousand  this  shall be  holy in all the borders thereof round about  
2	of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred  in length   with five hundred  in breadth   square round about  and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof  
3	and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand  and the breadth of ten thousand  and in it shall be the sanctuary  and  the most holy  place   
4	the holy  portion  of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary  which shall come near to minister unto the lord  and it shall be a place for their houses  and an holy place for the sanctuary  
5	and the five and twenty thousand of length  and the ten thousand of breadth  shall also the levites  the ministers of the house  have for themselves  for a possession for twenty chambers  
6	and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad  and five and twenty thousand long  over against the oblation of the holy  portion   it shall be for the whole house of israel  
7	and a  portion shall be  for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy  portion   and of the possession of the city  before the oblation of the holy  portion   and before the possession of the city  from the west side westward  and from the east side eastward  and the length  shall be  over against one of the portions  from the west border unto the east border  
8	in the land shall be his possession in israel  and my princes shall no more oppress my people  and  the rest of  the land shall they give to the house of israel according to their tribes  
9 	thus saith the lord god  let it suffice you  o princes of israel  remove violence and spoil  and execute judgment and justice  take away your exactions from my people  saith the lord god  
10	ye shall have just balances  and a just ephah  and a just bath  
11	the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure  that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer  and the ephah the tenth part of an homer  the measure thereof shall be after the homer  
12	and the shekel  shall be  twenty gerahs  twenty shekels  five and twenty shekels  fifteen shekels  shall be your maneh  
13 	this  is  the oblation that ye shall offer  the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat  and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley  
14	concerning the ordinance of oil  the bath of oil   ye shall offer  the tenth part of a bath out of the cor   which is  an homer of ten baths  for ten baths  are  an homer  
15	and one lamb out of the flock  out of two hundred  out of the fat pastures of israel  for a meat offering  and for a burnt offering  and for peace offerings  to make reconciliation for them  saith the lord god  
16	all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in israel  
17	and it shall be the prince s part  to give  burnt offerings  and meat offerings  and drink offerings  in the feasts  and in the new moons  and in the sabbaths  in all solemnities of the house of israel  he shall prepare the sin offering  and the meat offering  and the burnt offering  and the peace offerings  to make reconciliation for the house of israel  
18	thus saith the lord god  in the first  month   in the first  day  of the month  thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish  and cleanse the sanctuary  
19	and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering  and put  it  upon the posts of the house  and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar  and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court  
20	and so thou shalt do the seventh  day  of the month for every one that erreth  and for  him that is  simple  so shall ye reconcile the house  
21	in the first  month   in the fourteenth day of the month  ye shall have the passover  a feast of seven days  unleavened bread shall be eaten  
22	and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock  for  a sin offering  
23	and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the lord  seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days  and a kid of the goats daily  for  a sin offering  
24	and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock  and an ephah for a ram  and an hin of oil for an ephah  
25	in the seventh  month   in the fifteenth day of the month  shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days  according to the sin offering  according to the burnt offering  and according to the meat offering  and according to the oil  
ezekiel 46
1 	thus saith the lord god  the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days  but on the sabbath it shall be opened  and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened  
2	and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of  that  gate without  and shall stand by the post of the gate  and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings  and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate  then he shall go forth  but the gate shall not be shut until the evening  
3	likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons  
4	and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord in the sabbath day  shall be  six lambs without blemish  and a ram without blemish  
5	and the meat offering  shall be  an ephah for a ram  and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give  and an hin of oil to an ephah  
6	and in the day of the new moon  it shall be  a young bullock without blemish  and six lambs  and a ram  they shall be without blemish  
7	and he shall prepare a meat offering  an ephah for a bullock  and an ephah for a ram  and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto  and an hin of oil to an ephah  
8	and when the prince shall enter  he shall go in by the way of the porch of  that  gate  and he shall go forth by the way thereof  
9	but when the people of the land shall come before the lord in the solemn feasts  he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate  and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate  he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in  but shall go forth over against it  
10	and the prince in the midst of them  when they go in  shall go in  and when they go forth  shall go forth  
11	and in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock  and an ephah to a ram  and to the lambs as he is able to give  and an hin of oil to an ephah  
12	now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the lord   one  shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east  and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings  as he did on the sabbath day  then he shall go forth  and after his going forth  one  shall shut the gate  
13	thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord  of  a lamb of the first year without blemish  thou shalt prepare it every morning  
14	and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning  the sixth part of an ephah  and the third part of an hin of oil  to temper with the fine flour  a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord  
15	thus shall they prepare the lamb  and the meat offering  and the oil  every morning  for  a continual burnt offering  
16 	thus saith the lord god  if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons  the inheritance thereof shall be his sons   it  shall be  their possession by inheritance  
17	but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants  then it shall be his to the year of liberty  after it shall return to the prince  but his inheritance shall be his sons  for them  
18	moreover the prince shall not take of the people s inheritance by oppression  to thrust them out of their possession   but  he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession  that my people be not scattered every man from his possession  
19 	after he brought me through the entry  which  was  at the side of the gate  into the holy chambers of the priests  which looked toward the north  and  behold  there  was  a place on the two sides westward  
20	then said he unto me  this  is  the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering  where they shall bake the meat offering  that they bear  them  not out into the utter court  to sanctify the people  
21	then he brought me forth into the utter court  and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court  and  behold  in every corner of the court  there was  a court  
22	in the four corners of the court  there were  courts joined of forty  cubits  long and thirty broad  these four corners  were  of one measure  
23	and  there was  a row  of building  round about in them  round about them four  and  it was  made with boiling places under the rows round about  
24	then said he unto me  these  are  the places of them that boil  where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people  
ezekiel 47
1 	afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house  and  behold  waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward  for the forefront of the house  stood toward  the east  and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house  at the south  side  of the altar  
2	then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward  and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward  and  behold  there ran out waters on the right side  
3	and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward  he measured a thousand cubits  and he brought me through the waters  the waters  were  to the ankles  
4	again he measured a thousand  and brought me through the waters  the waters  were  to the knees  again he measured a thousand  and brought me through  the waters  were  to the loins  
5	afterward he measured a thousand   and it was  a river that i could not pass over  for the waters were risen  waters to swim in  a river that could not be passed over  
6	and he said unto me  son of man  hast thou seen  this   then he brought me  and caused me to return to the brink of the river  
7	now when i had returned  behold  at the bank of the river  were  very many trees on the one side and on the other  
8	then said he unto me  these waters issue out toward the east country  and go down into the desert  and go into the sea   which being  brought forth into the sea  the waters shall be healed  
9	and it shall come to pass   that  every thing that liveth  which moveth  whithersoever the rivers shall come  shall live  and there shall be a very great multitude of fish  because these waters shall come thither  for they shall be healed  and every thing shall live whither the river cometh  
10	and it shall come to pass   that  the fishers shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim  they shall be a  place  to spread forth nets  their fish shall be according to their kinds  as the fish of the great sea  exceeding many  
11	but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed  they shall be given to salt  
12	and by the river upon the bank thereof  on this side and on that side  shall grow all trees for meat  whose leaf shall not fade  neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed  it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months  because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary  and the fruit thereof shall be for meat  and the leaf thereof for medicine  
13 	thus saith the lord god  this  shall be  the border  whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of israel  joseph  shall have two  portions  
14	and ye shall inherit it  one as well as another   concerning  the which i lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers  and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance  
15	and this  shall be  the border of the land toward the north side  from the great sea  the way of hethlon  as men go to zedad  
16	hamath  berothah  sibraim  which  is  between the border of damascus and the border of hamath  hazarhatticon  which  is  by the coast of hauran  
17	and the border from the sea shall be hazarenan  the border of damascus  and the north northward  and the border of hamath  and  this is  the north side  
18	and the east side ye shall measure from hauran  and from damascus  and from gilead  and from the land of israel  by  jordan  from the border unto the east sea  and  this is  the east side  
19	and the south side southward  from tamar  even  to the waters of strife  in  kadesh  the river to the great sea  and  this is  the south side southward  
20	the west side also  shall be  the great sea from the border  till a man come over against hamath  this  is  the west side  
21	so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel  
22	and it shall come to pass   that  ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you  and to the strangers that sojourn among you  which shall beget children among you  and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of israel  they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of israel  
23	and it shall come to pass   that  in what tribe the stranger sojourneth  there shall ye give  him  his inheritance  saith the lord god

daniel
daniel 1
1 	in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem  and besieged it  
2	and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand  with part of the vessels of the house of god  which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god  and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god  
3	and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs  that he should bring  certain  of the children of israel  and of the king s seed  and of the princes  
4	children in whom  was  no blemish  but well favoured  and skilful in all wisdom  and cunning in knowledge  and understanding science  and such as  had  ability in them to stand in the king s palace  and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans  
5	and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king s meat  and of the wine which he drank  so nourishing them three years  that at the end thereof they might stand before the king  
6	now among these were of the children of judah  daniel  hananiah  mishael  and azariah  
7	unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names  for he gave unto daniel  the name  of belteshazzar  and to hananiah  of shadrach  and to mishael  of meshach  and to azariah  of abednego  
8 	but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king s meat  nor with the wine which he drank  therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself  
9	now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs  
10	and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel  i fear my lord the king  who hath appointed your meat and your drink  for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which  are  of your sort  then shall ye make  me  endanger my head to the king  
11	then said daniel to melzar  whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel  hananiah  mishael  and azariah  
12	prove thy servants  i beseech thee  ten days  and let them give us pulse to eat  and water to drink  
13	then let our countenances be looked upon before thee  and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king s meat  and as thou seest  deal with thy servants  
14	so he consented to them in this matter  and proved them ten days  
15	and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king s meat  
16	thus melzar took away the portion of their meat  and the wine that they should drink  and gave them pulse  
17 	as for these four children  god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom  and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams  
18	now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in  then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar  
19	and the king communed with them  and among them all was found none like daniel  hananiah  mishael  and azariah  therefore stood they before the king  
20	and in all matters of wisdom  and  understanding  that the king enquired of them  he found them ten times better than all the magicians  and  astrologers that  were  in all his realm  
21	and daniel continued  even  unto the first year of king cyrus  
daniel 2
1 	and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams  wherewith his spirit was troubled  and his sleep brake from him  
2	then the king commanded to call the magicians  and the astrologers  and the sorcerers  and the chaldeans  for to shew the king his dreams  so they came and stood before the king  
3	and the king said unto them  i have dreamed a dream  and my spirit was troubled to know the dream  
4	then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack  o king  live for ever  tell thy servants the dream  and we will shew the interpretation  
5	the king answered and said to the chaldeans  the thing is gone from me  if ye will not make known unto me the dream  with the interpretation thereof  ye shall be cut in pieces  and your houses shall be made a dunghill  
6	but if ye shew the dream  and the interpretation thereof  ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour  therefore shew me the dream  and the interpretation thereof  
7	they answered again and said  let the king tell his servants the dream  and we will shew the interpretation of it  
8	the king answered and said  i know of certainty that ye would gain the time  because ye see the thing is gone from me  
9	but if ye will not make known unto me the dream   there is but  one decree for you  for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me  till the time be changed  therefore tell me the dream  and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof  
10	the chaldeans answered before the king  and said  there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king s matter  therefore  there is  no king  lord  nor ruler   that  asked such things at any magician  or astrologer  or chaldean  
11	and  it is  a rare thing that the king requireth  and there is none other that can shew it before the king  except the gods  whose dwelling is not with flesh  
12	for this cause the king was angry and very furious  and commanded to destroy all the wise  men  of babylon  
13	and the decree went forth that the wise  men  should be slain  and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain  
14 	then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the king s guard  which was gone forth to slay the wise  men  of babylon  
15	he answered and said to arioch the king s captain  why  is  the decree  so  hasty from the king  then arioch made the thing known to daniel  
16	then daniel went in  and desired of the king that he would give him time  and that he would shew the king the interpretation  
17	then daniel went to his house  and made the thing known to hananiah  mishael  and azariah  his companions  
18	that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret  that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise  men  of babylon  
19	then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision  then daniel blessed the god of heaven  
20	daniel answered and said  blessed be the name of god for ever and ever  for wisdom and might are his  
21	and he changeth the times and the seasons  he removeth kings  and setteth up kings  he giveth wisdom unto the wise  and knowledge to them that know understanding  
22	he revealeth the deep and secret things  he knoweth what  is  in the darkness  and the light dwelleth with him  
23	i thank thee  and praise thee  o thou god of my fathers  who hast given me wisdom and might  and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee  for thou hast  now  made known unto us the king s matter  
24 	therefore daniel went in unto arioch  whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise  men  of babylon  he went and said thus unto him  destroy not the wise  men  of babylon  bring me in before the king  and i will shew unto the king the interpretation  
25	then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste  and said thus unto him  i have found a man of the captives of judah  that will make known unto the king the interpretation  
26	the king answered and said to daniel  whose name  was  belteshazzar  art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen  and the interpretation thereof  
27	daniel answered in the presence of the king  and said  the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise  men   the astrologers  the magicians  the soothsayers  shew unto the king  
28	but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets  and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days  thy dream  and the visions of thy head upon thy bed  are these  
29	as for thee  o king  thy thoughts came  into thy mind  upon thy bed  what should come to pass hereafter  and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass  
30	but as for me  this secret is not revealed to me for  any  wisdom that i have more than any living  but for  their  sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king  and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart  
31 	thou  o king  sawest  and behold a great image  this great image  whose brightness  was  excellent  stood before thee  and the form thereof  was  terrible  
32	this image s head  was  of fine gold  his breast and his arms of silver  his belly and his thighs of brass  
33	his legs of iron  his feet part of iron and part of clay  
34	thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands  which smote the image upon his feet  that were  of iron and clay  and brake them to pieces  
35	then was the iron  the clay  the brass  the silver  and the gold  broken to pieces together  and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors  and the wind carried them away  that no place was found for them  and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain  and filled the whole earth  
36	this  is  the dream  and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king  
37	thou  o king   art  a king of kings  for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom  power  and strength  and glory  
38	and wheresoever the children of men dwell  the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand  and hath made thee ruler over them all  thou  art  this head of gold  
39	and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee  and another third kingdom of brass  which shall bear rule over all the earth  
40	and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron  forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all  things   and as iron that breaketh all these  shall it break in pieces and bruise  
41	and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes  part of potters  clay  and part of iron  the kingdom shall be divided  but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron  forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay  
42	and  as  the toes of the feet  were  part of iron  and part of clay   so  the kingdom shall be partly strong  and partly broken  
43	and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay  they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men  but they shall not cleave one to another  even as iron is not mixed with clay  
44	and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom  which shall never be destroyed  and the kingdom shall not be left to other people   but  it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms  and it shall stand for ever  
45	forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands  and that it brake in pieces the iron  the brass  the clay  the silver  and the gold  the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter  and the dream  is  certain  and the interpretation thereof sure  
46 	then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face  and worshipped daniel  and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him  
47	the king answered unto daniel  and said  of a truth  it is   that your god  is  a god of gods  and a lord of kings  and a revealer of secrets  seeing thou couldest reveal this secret  
48	then the king made daniel a great man  and gave him many great gifts  and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon  and chief of the governors over all the wise  men  of babylon  
49	then daniel requested of the king  and he set shadrach  meshach  and abednego  over the affairs of the province of babylon  but daniel  sat  in the gate of the king  
daniel 3
1 	nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold  whose height  was  threescore cubits   and  the breadth thereof six cubits  he set it up in the plain of dura  in the province of babylon  
2	then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes  the governors  and the captains  the judges  the treasurers  the counsellors  the sheriffs  and all the rulers of the provinces  to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up  
3	then the princes  the governors  and captains  the judges  the treasurers  the counsellors  the sheriffs  and all the rulers of the provinces  were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up  and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up  
4	then an herald cried aloud  to you it is commanded  o people  nations  and languages  
5	 that  at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet  flute  harp  sackbut  psaltery  dulcimer  and all kinds of musick  ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up  
6	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace  
7	therefore at that time  when all the people heard the sound of the cornet  flute  harp  sackbut  psaltery  and all kinds of musick  all the people  the nations  and the languages  fell down  and  worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up  
8 	wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near  and accused the jews  
9	they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar  o king  live for ever  
10	thou  o king  hast made a decree  that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet  flute  harp  sackbut  psaltery  and dulcimer  and all kinds of musick  shall fall down and worship the golden image  
11	and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth   that  he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace  
12	there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon  shadrach  meshach  and abednego  these men  o king  have not regarded thee  they serve not thy gods  nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up  
13	then nebuchadnezzar in  his  rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach  meshach  and abednego  then they brought these men before the king  
14	nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them   is it  true  o shadrach  meshach  and abednego  do not ye serve my gods  nor worship the golden image which i have set up  
15	now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet  flute  harp  sackbut  psaltery  and dulcimer  and all kinds of musick  ye fall down and worship the image which i have made   well   but if ye worship not  ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace  and who  is  that god that shall deliver you out of my hands  
16	shadrach  meshach  and abednego  answered and said to the king  o nebuchadnezzar  we  are  not careful to answer thee in this matter  
17	if it be  so   our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace  and he will deliver  us  out of thine hand  o king  
18	but if not  be it known unto thee  o king  that we will not serve thy gods  nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up  
19 	then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury  and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach  meshach  and abednego   therefore  he spake  and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated  
20	and he commanded the most mighty men that  were  in his army to bind shadrach  meshach  and abednego   and  to cast  them  into the burning fiery furnace  
21	then these men were bound in their coats  their hosen  and their hats  and their  other  garments  and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace  
22	therefore because the king s commandment was urgent  and the furnace exceeding hot  the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach  meshach  and abednego  
23	and these three men  shadrach  meshach  and abednego  fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace  
24	then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied  and rose up in haste   and  spake  and said unto his counsellors  did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire  they answered and said unto the king  true  o king  
25	he answered and said  lo  i see four men loose  walking in the midst of the fire  and they have no hurt  and the form of the fourth is like the son of god  
26	then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace   and  spake  and said  shadrach  meshach  and abednego  ye servants of the most high god  come forth  and come  hither   then shadrach  meshach  and abednego  came forth of the midst of the fire  
27	and the princes  governors  and captains  and the king s counsellors  being gathered together  saw these men  upon whose bodies the fire had no power  nor was an hair of their head singed  neither were their coats changed  nor the smell of fire had passed on them  
28 	 then  nebuchadnezzar spake  and said  blessed  be  the god of shadrach  meshach  and abednego  who hath sent his angel  and delivered his servants that trusted in him  and have changed the king s word  and yielded their bodies  that they might not serve nor worship any god  except their own god  
29	therefore i make a decree  that every people  nation  and language  which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach  meshach  and abednego  shall be cut in pieces  and their houses shall be made a dunghill  because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort  
30	then the king promoted shadrach  meshach  and abednego  in the province of babylon  
daniel 4
1 	nebuchadnezzar the king  unto all people  nations  and languages  that dwell in all the earth  peace be multiplied unto you  
2	i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me  
3	how great  are  his signs  and how mighty  are  his wonders  his kingdom  is  an everlasting kingdom  and his dominion  is  from generation to generation  
4 	i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house  and flourishing in my palace  
5	i saw a dream which made me afraid  and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me  
6	therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise  men  of babylon before me  that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream  
7	then came in the magicians  the astrologers  the chaldeans  and the soothsayers  and i told the dream before them  but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof  
8	but at the last daniel came in before me  whose name  was  belteshazzar  according to the name of my god  and in whom  is  the spirit of the holy gods  and before him i told the dream   saying   
9	o belteshazzar  master of the magicians  because i know that the spirit of the holy gods  is  in thee  and no secret troubleth thee  tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen  and the interpretation thereof  
10	thus  were  the visions of mine head in my bed  i saw  and behold a tree in the midst of the earth  and the height thereof  was  great  
11	the tree grew  and was strong  and the height thereof reached unto heaven  and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth  
12	the leaves thereof  were  fair  and the fruit thereof much  and in it  was  meat for all  the beasts of the field had shadow under it  and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof  and all flesh was fed of it  
13	i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed  and  behold  a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven  
14	he cried aloud  and said thus  hew down the tree  and cut off his branches  shake off his leaves  and scatter his fruit  let the beasts get away from under it  and the fowls from his branches  
15	nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth  even with a band of iron and brass  in the tender grass of the field  and let it be wet with the dew of heaven  and  let  his portion  be  with the beasts in the grass of the earth  
16	let his heart be changed from man s  and let a beast s heart be given unto him  and let seven times pass over him  
17	this matter  is  by the decree of the watchers  and the demand by the word of the holy ones  to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men  and giveth it to whomsoever he will  and setteth up over it the basest of men  
18	this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen  now thou  o belteshazzar  declare the interpretation thereof  forasmuch as all the wise  men  of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation  but thou  art  able  for the spirit of the holy gods  is  in thee  
19 	then daniel  whose name  was  belteshazzar  was astonied for one hour  and his thoughts troubled him  the king spake  and said  belteshazzar  let not the dream  or the interpretation thereof  trouble thee  belteshazzar answered and said  my lord  the dream  be  to them that hate thee  and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies  
20	the tree that thou sawest  which grew  and was strong  whose height reached unto the heaven  and the sight thereof to all the earth  
21	whose leaves  were  fair  and the fruit thereof much  and in it  was  meat for all  under which the beasts of the field dwelt  and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation  
22	it  is  thou  o king  that art grown and become strong  for thy greatness is grown  and reacheth unto heaven  and thy dominion to the end of the earth  
23	and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven  and saying  hew the tree down  and destroy it  yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth  even with a band of iron and brass  in the tender grass of the field  and let it be wet with the dew of heaven  and  let  his portion  be  with the beasts of the field  till seven times pass over him  
24	this  is  the interpretation  o king  and this  is  the decree of the most high  which is come upon my lord the king  
25	that they shall drive thee from men  and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field  and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen  and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven  and seven times shall pass over thee  till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men  and giveth it to whomsoever he will  
26	and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots  thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee  after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule  
27	wherefore  o king  let my counsel be acceptable unto thee  and break off thy sins by righteousness  and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor  if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity  
28 	all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar  
29	at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon  
30	the king spake  and said  is not this great babylon  that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power  and for the honour of my majesty  
31	while the word  was  in the king s mouth  there fell a voice from heaven   saying   o king nebuchadnezzar  to thee it is spoken  the kingdom is departed from thee  
32	and they shall drive thee from men  and thy dwelling  shall be  with the beasts of the field  they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen  and seven times shall pass over thee  until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men  and giveth it to whomsoever he will  
33	the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar  and he was driven from men  and did eat grass as oxen  and his body was wet with the dew of heaven  till his hairs were grown like eagles   feathers   and his nails like birds   claws   
34 	and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven  and mine understanding returned unto me  and i blessed the most high  and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever  whose dominion  is  an everlasting dominion  and his kingdom  is  from generation to generation  
35	and all the inhabitants of the earth  are  reputed as nothing  and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven  and  among  the inhabitants of the earth  and none can stay his hand  or say unto him  what doest thou  
36	at the same time my reason returned unto me  and for the glory of my kingdom  mine honour and brightness returned unto me  and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me  and i was established in my kingdom  and excellent majesty was added unto me  
37	now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven  all whose works  are  truth  and his ways judgment  and those that walk in pride he is able to abase  
daniel 5
1 	belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords  and drank wine before the thousand  
2	belshazzar  whiles he tasted the wine  commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which  was  in jerusalem  that the king  and his princes  his wives  and his concubines  might drink therein  
3	then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which  was  at jerusalem  and the king  and his princes  his wives  and his concubines  drank in them  
4	they drank wine  and praised the gods of gold  and of silver  of brass  of iron  of wood  and of stone  
5	in the same hour came forth fingers of a man s hand  and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king s palace  and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote  
6	then the king s countenance was changed  and his thoughts troubled him  so that the joints of his loins were loosed  and his knees smote one against another  
7	the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers  the chaldeans  and the soothsayers   and  the king spake  and said to the wise  men  of babylon  whosoever shall read this writing  and shew me the interpretation thereof  shall be clothed with scarlet  and  have  a chain of gold about his neck  and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom  
8	then came in all the king s wise  men   but they could not read the writing  nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof  
9	then was king belshazzar greatly troubled  and his countenance was changed in him  and his lords were astonied  
10 	 now  the queen  by reason of the words of the king and his lords  came into the banquet house   and  the queen spake and said  o king  live for ever  let not thy thoughts trouble thee  nor let thy countenance be changed  
11	there is a man in thy kingdom  in whom  is  the spirit of the holy gods  and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom  like the wisdom of the gods  was found in him  whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father  the king   i say   thy father  made master of the magicians  astrologers  chaldeans   and  soothsayers  
12	forasmuch as an excellent spirit  and knowledge  and understanding  interpreting of dreams  and shewing of hard sentences  and dissolving of doubts  were found in the same daniel  whom the king named belteshazzar  now let daniel be called  and he will shew the interpretation  
13	then was daniel brought in before the king   and  the king spake and said unto daniel   art  thou that daniel  which  art  of the children of the captivity of judah  whom the king my father brought out of jewry  
14	i have even heard of thee  that the spirit of the gods  is  in thee  and  that  light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee  
15	and now the wise  men   the astrologers  have been brought in before me  that they should read this writing  and make known unto me the interpretation thereof  but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing  
16	and i have heard of thee  that thou canst make interpretations  and dissolve doubts  now if thou canst read the writing  and make known to me the interpretation thereof  thou shalt be clothed with scarlet  and  have  a chain of gold about thy neck  and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom  
17	then daniel answered and said before the king  let thy gifts be to thyself  and give thy rewards to another  yet i will read the writing unto the king  and make known to him the interpretation  
18	o thou king  the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom  and majesty  and glory  and honour  
19	and for the majesty that he gave him  all people  nations  and languages  trembled and feared before him  whom he would he slew  and whom he would he kept alive  and whom he would he set up  and whom he would he put down  
20	but when his heart was lifted up  and his mind hardened in pride  he was deposed from his kingly throne  and they took his glory from him  
21	and he was driven from the sons of men  and his heart was made like the beasts  and his dwelling  was  with the wild asses  they fed him with grass like oxen  and his body was wet with the dew of heaven  till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men  and  that  he appointeth over it whomsoever he will  
22	and thou his son  o belshazzar  hast not humbled thine heart  though thou knewest all this  
23	but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven  and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee  and thou  and thy lords  thy wives  and thy concubines  have drunk wine in them  and thou hast praised the gods of silver  and gold  of brass  iron  wood  and stone  which see not  nor hear  nor know  and the god in whose hand thy breath  is   and whose  are  all thy ways  hast thou not glorified  
24	then was the part of the hand sent from him  and this writing was written  
25	and this  is  the writing that was written  mene  mene  tekel  upharsin  
26	this  is  the interpretation of the thing  mene  god hath numbered thy kingdom  and finished it  
27	tekel  thou art weighed in the balances  and art found wanting  
28	peres  thy kingdom is divided  and given to the medes and persians  
29	then commanded belshazzar  and they clothed daniel with scarlet  and  put  a chain of gold about his neck  and made a proclamation concerning him  that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom  
30 	in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain  
31	and darius the median took the kingdom   being  about threescore and two years old  
daniel 6
1 	it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes  which should be over the whole kingdom  
2	and over these three presidents  of whom daniel  was  first  that the princes might give accounts unto them  and the king should have no damage  
3	then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes  because an excellent spirit  was  in him  and the king thought to set him over the whole realm  
4	then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom  but they could find none occasion nor fault  forasmuch as he  was  faithful  neither was there any error or fault found in him  
5	then said these men  we shall not find any occasion against this daniel  except we find  it  against him concerning the law of his god  
6 	then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king  and said thus unto him  king darius  live for ever  
7	all the presidents of the kingdom  the governors  and the princes  the counsellors  and the captains  have consulted together to establish a royal statute  and to make a firm decree  that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days  save of thee  o king  he shall be cast into the den of lions  
8	now  o king  establish the decree  and sign the writing  that it be not changed  according to the law of the medes and persians  which altereth not  
9	wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree  
10	now when daniel knew that the writing was signed  he went into his house  and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem  he kneeled upon his knees three times a day  and prayed  and gave thanks before his god  as he did aforetime  
11 	then these men assembled  and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god  
12	then they came near  and spake before the king concerning the king s decree  hast thou not signed a decree  that every man that shall ask  a petition  of any god or man within thirty days  save of thee  o king  shall be cast into the den of lions  the king answered and said  the thing  is  true  according to the law of the medes and persians  which altereth not  
13	then answered they and said before the king  that daniel  which  is  of the children of the captivity of judah  regardeth not thee  o king  nor the decree that thou hast signed  but maketh his petition three times a day  
14	then the king  when he heard  these  words  was sore displeased with himself  and set  his  heart on daniel to deliver him  and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him  
15	then these men assembled unto the king  and said unto the king  know  o king  that the law of the medes and persians  is   that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed  
16	then the king commanded  and they brought daniel  and cast  him  into the den of lions   now  the king spake and said unto daniel  thy god whom thou servest continually  he will deliver thee  
17	and a stone was brought  and laid upon the mouth of the den  and the king sealed it with his own signet  and with the signet of his lords  that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel  
18 	then the king went to his palace  and passed the night fasting  neither were instruments of musick brought before him  and his sleep went from him  
19	then the king arose very early in the morning  and went in haste unto the den of lions  
20	and when he came to the den  he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel   and  the king spake and said to daniel  o daniel  servant of the living god  is thy god  whom thou servest continually  able to deliver thee from the lions  
21	then said daniel unto the king  o king  live for ever  
22	my god hath sent his angel  and hath shut the lions  mouths  that they have not hurt me  forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me  and also before thee  o king  have i done no hurt  
23	then was the king exceeding glad for him  and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den  so daniel was taken up out of the den  and no manner of hurt was found upon him  because he believed in his god  
24	and the king commanded  and they brought those men which had accused daniel  and they cast  them  into the den of lions  them  their children  and their wives  and the lions had the mastery of them  and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den  
25 	then king darius wrote unto all people  nations  and languages  that dwell in all the earth  peace be multiplied unto you  
26	i make a decree  that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel  for he  is  the living god  and stedfast for ever  and his kingdom  that  which shall not be destroyed  and his dominion  shall be even  unto the end  
27	he delivereth and rescueth  and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth  who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions  
28	so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius  and in the reign of cyrus the persian  
daniel 7
1 	in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed  then he wrote the dream   and  told the sum of the matters  
2	daniel spake and said  i saw in my vision by night  and  behold  the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea  
3	and four great beasts came up from the sea  diverse one from another  
4	the first  was  like a lion  and had eagle s wings  i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked  and it was lifted up from the earth  and made stand upon the feet as a man  and a man s heart was given to it  
5	and behold another beast  a second  like to a bear  and it raised up itself on one side  and  it had  three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it  and they said thus unto it  arise  devour much flesh  
6	after this i beheld  and lo another  like a leopard  which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl  the beast had also four heads  and dominion was given to it  
7	after this i saw in the night visions  and behold a fourth beast  dreadful and terrible  and strong exceedingly  and it had great iron teeth  it devoured and brake in pieces  and stamped the residue with the feet of it  and it  was  diverse from all the beasts that  were  before it  and it had ten horns  
8	i considered the horns  and  behold  there came up among them another little horn  before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots  and  behold  in this horn  were  eyes like the eyes of man  and a mouth speaking great things  
9 	i beheld till the thrones were cast down  and the ancient of days did sit  whose garment  was  white as snow  and the hair of his head like the pure wool  his throne  was like  the fiery flame   and  his wheels  as  burning fire  
10	a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him  thousand thousands ministered unto him  and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him  the judgment was set  and the books were opened  
11	i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake  i beheld  even  till the beast was slain  and his body destroyed  and given to the burning flame  
12	as concerning the rest of the beasts  they had their dominion taken away  yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time  
13	i saw in the night visions  and  behold   one  like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven  and came to the ancient of days  and they brought him near before him  
14	and there was given him dominion  and glory  and a kingdom  that all people  nations  and languages  should serve him  his dominion  is  an everlasting dominion  which shall not pass away  and his kingdom  that  which shall not be destroyed  
15 	i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of  my  body  and the visions of my head troubled me  
16	i came near unto one of them that stood by  and asked him the truth of all this  so he told me  and made me know the interpretation of the things  
17	these great beasts  which are four   are  four kings   which  shall arise out of the earth  
18	but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom  and possess the kingdom for ever  even for ever and ever  
19	then i would know the truth of the fourth beast  which was diverse from all the others  exceeding dreadful  whose teeth  were of  iron  and his nails  of  brass   which  devoured  brake in pieces  and stamped the residue with his feet  
20	and of the ten horns that  were  in his head  and  of  the other which came up  and before whom three fell  even  of  that horn that had eyes  and a mouth that spake very great things  whose look  was  more stout than his fellows  
21	i beheld  and the same horn made war with the saints  and prevailed against them  
22	until the ancient of days came  and judgment was given to the saints of the most high  and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom  
23	thus he said  the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth  which shall be diverse from all kingdoms  and shall devour the whole earth  and shall tread it down  and break it in pieces  
24	and the ten horns out of this kingdom  are  ten kings  that  shall arise  and another shall rise after them  and he shall be diverse from the first  and he shall subdue three kings  
25	and he shall speak  great  words against the most high  and shall wear out the saints of the most high  and think to change times and laws  and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time  
26	but the judgment shall sit  and they shall take away his dominion  to consume and to destroy  it  unto the end  
27	and the kingdom and dominion  and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven  shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high  whose kingdom  is  an everlasting kingdom  and all dominions shall serve and obey him  
28	hitherto  is  the end of the matter  as for me daniel  my cogitations much troubled me  and my countenance changed in me  but i kept the matter in my heart  
daniel 8
1 	in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me   even unto  me daniel  after that which appeared unto me at the first  
2	and i saw in a vision  and it came to pass  when i saw  that i  was  at shushan  in  the palace  which  is  in the province of elam  and i saw in a vision  and i was by the river of ulai  
3	then i lifted up mine eyes  and saw  and  behold  there stood before the river a ram which had  two  horns  and the  two  horns  were  high  but one  was  higher than the other  and the higher came up last  
4	i saw the ram pushing westward  and northward  and southward  so that no beasts might stand before him  neither  was there any  that could deliver out of his hand  but he did according to his will  and became great  
5	and as i was considering  behold  an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth  and touched not the ground  and the goat  had  a notable horn between his eyes  
6	and he came to the ram that had  two  horns  which i had seen standing before the river  and ran unto him in the fury of his power  
7	and i saw him come close unto the ram  and he was moved with choler against him  and smote the ram  and brake his two horns  and there was no power in the ram to stand before him  but he cast him down to the ground  and stamped upon him  and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand  
8	therefore the he goat waxed very great  and when he was strong  the great horn was broken  and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven  
9	and out of one of them came forth a little horn  which waxed exceeding great  toward the south  and toward the east  and toward the pleasant  land   
10	and it waxed great   even  to the host of heaven  and it cast down  some  of the host and of the stars to the ground  and stamped upon them  
11	yea  he magnified  himself  even to the prince of the host  and by him the daily  sacrifice  was taken away  and the place of his sanctuary was cast down  
12	and an host was given  him  against the daily  sacrifice  by reason of transgression  and it cast down the truth to the ground  and it practised  and prospered  
13	then i heard one saint speaking  and another saint said unto that certain  saint  which spake  how long  shall be  the vision  concerning  the daily  sacrifice   and the transgression of desolation  to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot  
14	and he said unto me  unto two thousand and three hundred days  then shall the sanctuary be cleansed  
15 	and it came to pass  when i   even  i daniel  had seen the vision  and sought for the meaning  then  behold  there stood before me as the appearance of a man  
16	and i heard a man s voice between  the banks of  ulai  which called  and said  gabriel  make this  man  to understand the vision  
17	so he came near where i stood  and when he came  i was afraid  and fell upon my face  but he said unto me  understand  o son of man  for at the time of the end  shall be  the vision  
18	now as he was speaking with me  i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground  but he touched me  and set me upright  
19	and he said  behold  i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation  for at the time appointed the end  shall be   
20	the ram which thou sawest having  two  horns  are  the kings of media and persia  
21	and the rough goat  is  the king of grecia  and the great horn that  is  between his eyes  is  the first king  
22	now that being broken  whereas four stood up for it  four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation  but not in his power  
23	and in the latter time of their kingdom  when the transgressors are come to the full  a king of fierce countenance  and understanding dark sentences  shall stand up  
24	and his power shall be mighty  but not by his own power  and he shall destroy wonderfully  and shall prosper  and practise  and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people  
25	and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand  and he shall magnify  himself  in his heart  and by peace shall destroy many  he shall also stand up against the prince of princes  but he shall be broken without hand  
26	and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told  is  true  wherefore shut thou up the vision  for it  shall be  for many days  
27	and i daniel fainted  and was sick  certain  days  afterward i rose up  and did the king s business  and i was astonished at the vision  but none understood  it   
daniel 9
1 	in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus  of the seed of the medes  which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans  
2	in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years  whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet  that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem  
3	and i set my face unto the lord god  to seek by prayer and supplications  with fasting  and sackcloth  and ashes  
4 	and i prayed unto the lord my god  and made my confession  and said  o lord  the great and dreadful god  keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him  and to them that keep his commandments  
5	we have sinned  and have committed iniquity  and have done wickedly  and have rebelled  even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments  
6	neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets  which spake in thy name to our kings  our princes  and our fathers  and to all the people of the land  
7	o lord  righteousness  belongeth  unto thee  but unto us confusion of faces  as at this day  to the men of judah  and to the inhabitants of jerusalem  and unto all israel   that are  near  and  that are  far off  through all the countries whither thou hast driven them  because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee  
8	o lord  to us  belongeth  confusion of face  to our kings  to our princes  and to our fathers  because we have sinned against thee  
9	to the lord our god  belong  mercies and forgivenesses  though we have rebelled against him  
10	neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god  to walk in his laws  which he set before us by his servants the prophets  
11	yea  all israel have transgressed thy law  even by departing  that they might not obey thy voice  therefore the curse is poured upon us  and the oath that  is  written in the law of moses the servant of god  because we have sinned against him  
12	and he hath confirmed his words  which he spake against us  and against our judges that judged us  by bringing upon us a great evil  for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem  
13	as  it is  written in the law of moses  all this evil is come upon us  yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god  that we might turn from our iniquities  and understand thy truth  
14	therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil  and brought it upon us  for the lord our god  is  righteous in all his works which he doeth  for we obeyed not his voice  
15	and now  o lord our god  that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand  and hast gotten thee renown  as at this day  we have sinned  we have done wickedly  
16	o lord  according to all thy righteousness  i beseech thee  let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem  thy holy mountain  because for our sins  and for the iniquities of our fathers  jerusalem and thy people  are become  a reproach to all  that are  about us  
17	now therefore  o our god  hear the prayer of thy servant  and his supplications  and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate  for the lord s sake  
18	o my god  incline thine ear  and hear  open thine eyes  and behold our desolations  and the city which is called by thy name  for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses  but for thy great mercies  
19	o lord  hear  o lord  forgive  o lord  hearken and do  defer not  for thine own sake  o my god  for thy city and thy people are called by thy name  
20 	and whiles i  was  speaking  and praying  and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel  and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god  
21	yea  whiles i  was  speaking in prayer  even the man gabriel  whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning  being caused to fly swiftly  touched me about the time of the evening oblation  
22	and he informed  me   and talked with me  and said  o daniel  i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding  
23	at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth  and i am come to shew  thee   for thou  art  greatly beloved  therefore understand the matter  and consider the vision  
24	seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city  to finish the transgression  and to make an end of sins  and to make reconciliation for iniquity  and to bring in everlasting righteousness  and to seal up the vision and prophecy  and to anoint the most holy  
25	know therefore and understand   that  from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince  shall be  seven weeks  and threescore and two weeks  the street shall be built again  and the wall  even in troublous times  
26	and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off  but not for himself  and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary  and the end thereof  shall be  with a flood  and unto the end of the war desolations are determined  
27	and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week  and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease  and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make  it  desolate  even until the consummation  and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate  
daniel 10
1 	in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel  whose name was called belteshazzar  and the thing  was  true  but the time appointed  was  long  and he understood the thing  and had understanding of the vision  
2	in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks  
3	i ate no pleasant bread  neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth  neither did i anoint myself at all  till three whole weeks were fulfilled  
4	and in the four and twentieth day of the first month  as i was by the side of the great river  which  is  hiddekel  
5	then i lifted up mine eyes  and looked  and behold a certain man clothed in linen  whose loins  were  girded with fine gold of uphaz  
6	his body also  was  like the beryl  and his face as the appearance of lightning  and his eyes as lamps of fire  and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass  and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude  
7	and i daniel alone saw the vision  for the men that were with me saw not the vision  but a great quaking fell upon them  so that they fled to hide themselves  
8	therefore i was left alone  and saw this great vision  and there remained no strength in me  for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption  and i retained no strength  
9	yet heard i the voice of his words  and when i heard the voice of his words  then was i in a deep sleep on my face  and my face toward the ground  
10 	and  behold  an hand touched me  which set me upon my knees and  upon  the palms of my hands  
11	and he said unto me  o daniel  a man greatly beloved  understand the words that i speak unto thee  and stand upright  for unto thee am i now sent  and when he had spoken this word unto me  i stood trembling  
12	then said he unto me  fear not  daniel  for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand  and to chasten thyself before thy god  thy words were heard  and i am come for thy words  
13	but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days  but  lo  michael  one of the chief princes  came to help me  and i remained there with the kings of persia  
14	now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days  for yet the vision  is  for  many  days  
15	and when he had spoken such words unto me  i set my face toward the ground  and i became dumb  
16	and  behold   one  like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips  then i opened my mouth  and spake  and said unto him that stood before me  o my lord  by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me  and i have retained no strength  
17	for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord  for as for me  straightway there remained no strength in me  neither is there breath left in me  
18	then there came again and touched me  one  like the appearance of a man  and he strengthened me  
19	and said  o man greatly beloved  fear not  peace  be  unto thee  be strong  yea  be strong  and when he had spoken unto me  i was strengthened  and said  let my lord speak  for thou hast strengthened me  
20	then said he  knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee  and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia  and when i am gone forth  lo  the prince of grecia shall come  
21	but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth  and  there is  none that holdeth with me in these things  but michael your prince  
daniel 11
1 	also i in the first year of darius the mede   even  i  stood to confirm and to strengthen him  
2	and now will i shew thee the truth  behold  there shall stand up yet three kings in persia  and the fourth shall be far richer than  they  all  and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia  
3	and a mighty king shall stand up  that shall rule with great dominion  and do according to his will  
4	and when he shall stand up  his kingdom shall be broken  and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven  and not to his posterity  nor according to his dominion which he ruled  for his kingdom shall be plucked up  even for others beside those  
5 	and the king of the south shall be strong  and  one  of his princes  and he shall be strong above him  and have dominion  his dominion  shall be  a great dominion  
6	and in the end of years they shall join themselves together  for the king s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement  but she shall not retain the power of the arm  neither shall he stand  nor his arm  but she shall be given up  and they that brought her  and he that begat her  and he that strengthened her in  these  times  
7	but out of a branch of her roots shall  one  stand up in his estate  which shall come with an army  and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north  and shall deal against them  and shall prevail  
8	and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods  with their princes   and  with their precious vessels of silver and of gold  and he shall continue  more  years than the king of the north  
9	so the king of the south shall come into  his  kingdom  and shall return into his own land  
10	but his sons shall be stirred up  and shall assemble a multitude of great forces  and  one  shall certainly come  and overflow  and pass through  then shall he return  and be stirred up   even  to his fortress  
11	and the king of the south shall be moved with choler  and shall come forth and fight with him   even  with the king of the north  and he shall set forth a great multitude  but the multitude shall be given into his hand  
12	 and  when he hath taken away the multitude  his heart shall be lifted up  and he shall cast down  many  ten thousands  but he shall not be strengthened  by it   
13	for the king of the north shall return  and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former  and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches  
14	and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south  also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision  but they shall fall  
15	so the king of the north shall come  and cast up a mount  and take the most fenced cities  and the arms of the south shall not withstand  neither his chosen people  neither  shall there be any  strength to withstand  
16	but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will  and none shall stand before him  and he shall stand in the glorious land  which by his hand shall be consumed  
17	he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom  and upright ones with him  thus shall he do  and he shall give him the daughter of women  corrupting her  but she shall not stand  on his side   neither be for him  
18	after this shall he turn his face unto the isles  and shall take many  but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease  without his own reproach he shall cause  it  to turn upon him  
19	then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land  but he shall stumble and fall  and not be found  
20	then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes  in  the glory of the kingdom  but within few days he shall be destroyed  neither in anger  nor in battle  
21 	and in his estate shall stand up a vile person  to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom  but he shall come in peaceably  and obtain the kingdom by flatteries  
22	and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him  and shall be broken  yea  also the prince of the covenant  
23	and after the league  made  with him he shall work deceitfully  for he shall come up  and shall become strong with a small people  
24	he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province  and he shall do  that  which his fathers have not done  nor his fathers  fathers  he shall scatter among them the prey  and spoil  and riches   yea   and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds  even for a time  
25	and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army  and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army  but he shall not stand  for they shall forecast devices against him  
26	yea  they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him  and his army shall overflow  and many shall fall down slain  
27	and both these kings  hearts  shall be  to do mischief  and they shall speak lies at one table  but it shall not prosper  for yet the end  shall be  at the time appointed  
28	then shall he return into his land with great riches  and his heart  shall be  against the holy covenant  and he shall do  exploits   and return to his own land  
29	at the time appointed he shall return  and come toward the south  but it shall not be as the former  or as the latter  
30	for the ships of chittim shall come against him  therefore he shall be grieved  and return  and have indignation against the holy covenant  so shall he do  he shall even return  and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant  
31	and arms shall stand on his part  and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength  and shall take away the daily  sacrifice   and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate  
32	and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries  but the people that do know their god shall be strong  and do  exploits   
33	and they that understand among the people shall instruct many  yet they shall fall by the sword  and by flame  by captivity  and by spoil   many  days  
34	now when they shall fall  they shall be holpen with a little help  but many shall cleave to them with flatteries  
35	and  some  of them of understanding shall fall  to try them  and to purge  and to make  them  white   even  to the time of the end  because  it is  yet for a time appointed  
36	and the king shall do according to his will  and he shall exalt himself  and magnify himself above every god  and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods  and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished  for that that is determined shall be done  
37	neither shall he regard the god of his fathers  nor the desire of women  nor regard any god  for he shall magnify himself above all  
38	but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces  and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold  and silver  and with precious stones  and pleasant things  
39	thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god  whom he shall acknowledge  and  increase with glory  and he shall cause them to rule over many  and shall divide the land for gain  
40	and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him  and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind  with chariots  and with horsemen  and with many ships  and he shall enter into the countries  and shall overflow and pass over  
41	he shall enter also into the glorious land  and many  countries  shall be overthrown  but these shall escape out of his hand   even  edom  and moab  and the chief of the children of ammon  
42	he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries  and the land of egypt shall not escape  
43	but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver  and over all the precious things of egypt  and the libyans and the ethiopians  shall be  at his steps  
44	but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him  therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy  and utterly to make away many  
45	and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain  yet he shall come to his end  and none shall help him  
daniel 12
1 	and at that time shall michael stand up  the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people  and there shall be a time of trouble  such as never was since there was a nation  even  to that same time  and at that time thy people shall be delivered  every one that shall be found written in the book  
2	and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake  some to everlasting life  and some to shame  and  everlasting contempt  
3	and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament  and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever  
4	but thou  o daniel  shut up the words  and seal the book   even  to the time of the end  many shall run to and fro  and knowledge shall be increased  
5 	then i daniel looked  and  behold  there stood other two  the one on this side of the bank of the river  and the other on that side of the bank of the river  
6	and  one  said to the man clothed in linen  which  was  upon the waters of the river  how long  shall it be to  the end of these wonders  
7	and i heard the man clothed in linen  which  was  upon the waters of the river  when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven  and sware by him that liveth for ever that  it shall be  for a time  times  and an half  and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people  all these  things  shall be finished  
8	and i heard  but i understood not  then said i  o my lord  what  shall be  the end of these  things   
9	and he said  go thy way  daniel  for the words  are  closed up and sealed till the time of the end  
10	many shall be purified  and made white  and tried  but the wicked shall do wickedly  and none of the wicked shall understand  but the wise shall understand  
11	and from the time  that  the daily  sacrifice  shall be taken away  and the abomination that maketh desolate set up   there shall be  a thousand two hundred and ninety days  
12	blessed  is  he that waiteth  and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days  
13	but go thou thy way till the end  be   for thou shalt rest  and stand in thy lot at the end of the days  

hosea
hosea 1
1 	the word of the lord that came unto hosea  the son of beeri  in the days of uzziah  jotham  ahaz   and  hezekiah  kings of judah  and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash  king of israel  
2 	the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea  and the lord said to hosea  go  take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms  for the land hath committed great whoredom   departing  from the lord  
3	so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim  which conceived  and bare him a son  
4	and the lord said unto him  call his name jezreel  for yet a little  while   and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu  and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel  
5	and it shall come to pass at that day  that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel  
6	and she conceived again  and bare a daughter  and  god  said unto him  call her name loruhamah  for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel  but i will utterly take them away  
7	but i will have mercy upon the house of judah  and will save them by the lord their god  and will not save them by bow  nor by sword  nor by battle  by horses  nor by horsemen  
8 	now when she had weaned loruhamah  she conceived  and bare a son  
9	then said  god   call his name loammi  for ye  are  not my people  and i will not be your  god   
10	yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea  which cannot be measured nor numbered  and it shall come to pass   that  in the place where it was said unto them  ye  are  not my people   there  it shall be said unto them   ye are  the sons of the living god  
11	then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gathered together  and appoint themselves one head  and they shall come up out of the land  for great  shall be  the day of jezreel

2	plead with your mother  plead  for she  is  not my wife  neither  am  i her husband  let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight  and her adulteries from between her breasts  
3	lest i strip her naked  and set her as in the day that she was born  and make her as a wilderness  and set her like a dry land  and slay her with thirst  
4	and i will not have mercy upon her children  for they  be  the children of whoredoms  
5	for their mother hath played the harlot  she that conceived them hath done shamefully  for she said  i will go after my lovers  that give  me  my bread and my water  my wool and my flax  mine oil and my drink  
6 	therefore  behold  i will hedge up thy way with thorns  and make a wall  that she shall not find her paths  
7	and she shall follow after her lovers  but she shall not overtake them  and she shall seek them  but shall not find  them   then shall she say  i will go and return to my first husband  for then  was it  better with me than now  
8	for she did not know that i gave her corn  and wine  and oil  and multiplied her silver and gold   which  they prepared for baal  
9	therefore will i return  and take away my corn in the time thereof  and my wine in the season thereof  and will recover my wool and my flax  given  to cover her nakedness  
10	and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers  and none shall deliver her out of mine hand  
11	i will also cause all her mirth to cease  her feast days  her new moons  and her sabbaths  and all her solemn feasts  
12	and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees  whereof she hath said  these  are  my rewards that my lovers have given me  and i will make them a forest  and the beasts of the field shall eat them  
13	and i will visit upon her the days of baalim  wherein she burned incense to them  and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels  and she went after her lovers  and forgat me  saith the lord  
14 	therefore  behold  i will allure her  and bring her into the wilderness  and speak comfortably unto her  
15	and i will give her her vineyards from thence  and the valley of achor for a door of hope  and she shall sing there  as in the days of her youth  and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt  
16	and it shall be at that day  saith the lord   that  thou shalt call me ishi  and shalt call me no more baali  
17	for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth  and they shall no more be remembered by their name  
18	and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field  and with the fowls of heaven  and  with  the creeping things of the ground  and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth  and will make them to lie down safely  
19	and i will betroth thee unto me for ever  yea  i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness  and in judgment  and in lovingkindness  and in mercies  
20	i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness  and thou shalt know the lord  
21	and it shall come to pass in that day  i will hear  saith the lord  i will hear the heavens  and they shall hear the earth  
22	and the earth shall hear the corn  and the wine  and the oil  and they shall hear jezreel  
23	and i will sow her unto me in the earth  and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy  and i will say to  them which were  not my people  thou  art  my people  and they shall say   thou art  my god

1 	then said the lord unto me  go yet  love a woman beloved of  her  friend  yet an adulteress  according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel  who look to other gods  and love flagons of wine  
2	so i bought her to me for fifteen  pieces  of silver  and  for  an homer of barley  and an half homer of barley  
3	and i said unto her  thou shalt abide for me many days  thou shalt not play the harlot  and thou shalt not be for  another  man  so  will  i also  be  for thee  
4	for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king  and without a prince  and without a sacrifice  and without an image  and without an ephod  and  without  teraphim  
5	afterward shall the children of israel return  and seek the lord their god  and david their king  and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days  
hosea 4
1 	hear the word of the lord  ye children of israel  for the lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land  because  there is  no truth  nor mercy  nor knowledge of god in the land  
2	by swearing  and lying  and killing  and stealing  and committing adultery  they break out  and blood toucheth blood  
3	therefore shall the land mourn  and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish  with the beasts of the field  and with the fowls of heaven  yea  the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away  
4	yet let no man strive  nor reprove another  for thy people  are  as they that strive with the priest  
5	therefore shalt thou fall in the day  and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night  and i will destroy thy mother  
6 	my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge  because thou hast rejected knowledge  i will also reject thee  that thou shalt be no priest to me  seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god  i will also forget thy children  
7	as they were increased  so they sinned against me   therefore  will i change their glory into shame  
8	they eat up the sin of my people  and they set their heart on their iniquity  
9	and there shall be  like people  like priest  and i will punish them for their ways  and reward them their doings  
10	for they shall eat  and not have enough  they shall commit whoredom  and shall not increase  because they have left off to take heed to the lord  
11	whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart  
12 	my people ask counsel at their stocks  and their staff declareth unto them  for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused  them  to err  and they have gone a whoring from under their god  
13	they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains  and burn incense upon the hills  under oaks and poplars and elms  because the shadow thereof  is  good  therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom  and your spouses shall commit adultery  
14	i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom  nor your spouses when they commit adultery  for themselves are separated with whores  and they sacrifice with harlots  therefore the people  that  doth not understand shall fall  
15	though thou  israel  play the harlot   yet  let not judah offend  and come not ye unto gilgal  neither go ye up to bethaven  nor swear  the lord liveth  
16	for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer  now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place  
17	ephraim  is  joined to idols  let him alone  
18	their drink is sour  they have committed whoredom continually  her rulers  with  shame do love  give ye  
19	the wind hath bound her up in her wings  and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices  
hosea 5
1 	hear ye this  o priests  and hearken  ye house of israel  and give ye ear  o house of the king  for judgment  is  toward you  because ye have been a snare on mizpah  and a net spread upon tabor  
2	and the revolters are profound to make slaughter  though i  have been  a rebuker of them all  
3	i know ephraim  and israel is not hid from me  for now  o ephraim  thou committest whoredom   and  israel is defiled  
4	they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god  for the spirit of whoredoms  is  in the midst of them  and they have not known the lord  
5	and the pride of israel doth testify to his face  therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity  judah also shall fall with them  
6	they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the lord  but they shall not find  him   he hath withdrawn himself from them  
7	they have dealt treacherously against the lord  for they have begotten strange children  now shall a month devour them with their portions  
8 	blow ye the cornet in gibeah   and  the trumpet in ramah  cry aloud  at  bethaven  after thee  o benjamin  
9	ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke  among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be  
10	the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound   therefore  i will pour out my wrath upon them like water  
11	ephraim  is  oppressed  and  broken in judgment  because he willingly walked after the commandment  
12	therefore  will  i  be  unto ephraim as a moth  and to the house of judah as rottenness  
13	when ephraim saw his sickness  and judah  saw  his wound  then went ephraim to the assyrian  and sent to king jareb  yet could he not heal you  nor cure you of your wound  
14	for i  will be  unto ephraim as a lion  and as a young lion to the house of judah  i   even  i  will tear and go away  i will take away  and none shall rescue  him   
15	i will go  and  return to my place  till they acknowledge their offence  and seek my face  in their affliction they will seek me early  
hosea 6
1 	come  and let us return unto the lord  for he hath torn  and he will heal us  he hath smitten  and he will bind us up  
2	after two days will he revive us  in the third day he will raise us up  and we shall live in his sight  
3	then shall we know   if  we follow on to know the lord  his going forth is prepared as the morning  and he shall come unto us as the rain  as the latter  and  former rain unto the earth  
4 	o ephraim  what shall i do unto thee  o judah  what shall i do unto thee  for your goodness  is  as a morning cloud  and as the early dew it goeth away  
5	therefore have i hewed  them  by the prophets  i have slain them by the words of my mouth  and thy judgments  are as  the light  that  goeth forth  
6	for i desired mercy  and not sacrifice  and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings  
7	but they like men have transgressed the covenant  there have they dealt treacherously against me  
8	gilead  is  a city of them that work iniquity   and is  polluted with blood  
9	and as troops of robbers wait for a man   so  the company of priests murder in the way by consent  for they commit lewdness  
10	i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel  there  is  the whoredom of ephraim  israel is defiled  
11	also  o judah  he hath set an harvest for thee  when i returned the captivity of my people  
hosea 7
1 	when i would have healed israel  then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered  and the wickedness of samaria  for they commit falsehood  and the thief cometh in   and  the troop of robbers spoileth without  
2	and they consider not in their hearts  that  i remember all their wickedness  now their own doings have beset them about  they are before my face  
3	they make the king glad with their wickedness  and the princes with their lies  
4	they  are  all adulterers  as an oven heated by the baker   who  ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough  until it be leavened  
5	in the day of our king the princes have made  him  sick with bottles of wine  he stretched out his hand with scorners  
6	for they have made ready their heart like an oven  whiles they lie in wait  their baker sleepeth all the night  in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire  
7	they are all hot as an oven  and have devoured their judges  all their kings are fallen   there is  none among them that calleth unto me  
8 	ephraim  he hath mixed himself among the people  ephraim is a cake not turned  
9	strangers have devoured his strength  and he knoweth  it  not  yea  gray hairs are here and there upon him  yet he knoweth not  
10	and the pride of israel testifieth to his face  and they do not return to the lord their god  nor seek him for all this  
11	ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart  they call to egypt  they go to assyria  
12	when they shall go  i will spread my net upon them  i will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven  i will chastise them  as their congregation hath heard  
13	woe unto them  for they have fled from me  destruction unto them  because they have transgressed against me  though i have redeemed them  yet they have spoken lies against me  
14	and they have not cried unto me with their heart  when they howled upon their beds  they assemble themselves for corn and wine   and  they rebel against me  
15	though i have bound  and  strengthened their arms  yet do they imagine mischief against me  
16	they return   but  not to the most high  they are like a deceitful bow  their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue  this  shall be  their derision in the land of egypt  
hosea 8
1 	 set  the trumpet to thy mouth   he shall come  as an eagle against the house of the lord  because they have transgressed my covenant  and trespassed against my law  
2	israel shall cry unto me  my god  we know thee  
3	israel hath cast off  the thing that is  good  the enemy shall pursue him  
4	they have set up kings  but not by me  they have made princes  and i knew  it  not  of their silver and their gold have they made them idols  that they may be cut off  
5	thy calf  o samaria  hath cast  thee  off  mine anger is kindled against them  how long  will it be  ere they attain to innocency  
6	for from israel  was  it also  the workman made it  therefore it  is  not god  but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces  
7	for they have sown the wind  and they shall reap the whirlwind  it hath no stalk  the bud shall yield no meal  if so be it yield  the strangers shall swallow it up  
8 	israel is swallowed up  now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure  
9	for they are gone up to assyria  a wild ass alone by himself  ephraim hath hired lovers  
10	yea  though they have hired among the nations  now will i gather them  and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes  
11	because ephraim hath made many altars to sin  altars shall be unto him to sin  
12	i have written to him the great things of my law   but  they were counted as a strange thing  
13	they sacrifice flesh  for  the sacrifices of mine offerings  and eat  it  but  the lord accepteth them not  now will he remember their iniquity  and visit their sins  they shall return to egypt  
14	for israel hath forgotten his maker  and buildeth temples  and judah hath multiplied fenced cities  but i will send a fire upon his cities  and it shall devour the palaces thereof  
hosea 9
1 	rejoice not  o israel  for joy  as  other  people  for thou hast gone a whoring from thy god  thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor  
2	the floor and the winepress shall not feed them  and the new wine shall fail in her  
3	they shall not dwell in the lord s land  but ephraim shall return to egypt  and they shall eat unclean  things  in assyria  
4	they shall not offer wine  offerings  to the lord  neither shall they be pleasing unto him  their sacrifices  shall be  unto them as the bread of mourners  all that eat thereof shall be polluted  for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord  
5	what will ye do in the solemn day  and in the day of the feast of the lord  
6	for  lo  they are gone because of destruction  egypt shall gather them up  memphis shall bury them  the pleasant  places  for their silver  nettles shall possess them  thorns  shall be  in their tabernacles  
7 	the days of visitation are come  the days of recompence are come  israel shall know  it   the prophet  is  a fool  the spiritual man  is  mad  for the multitude of thine iniquity  and the great hatred  
8	the watchman of ephraim  was  with my god   but  the prophet  is  a snare of a fowler in all his ways   and  hatred in the house of his god  
9	they have deeply corrupted  themselves   as in the days of gibeah   therefore  he will remember their iniquity  he will visit their sins  
10	i found israel like grapes in the wilderness  i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time   but  they went to baalpeor  and separated themselves unto  that  shame  and  their  abominations were according as they loved  
11 	 as for  ephraim  their glory shall fly away like a bird  from the birth  and from the womb  and from the conception  
12	though they bring up their children  yet will i bereave them   that there shall  not  be  a man  left   yea  woe also to them when i depart from them  
13	ephraim  as i saw tyrus   is  planted in a pleasant place  but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer  
14	give them  o lord  what wilt thou give  give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts  
15	all their wickedness  is  in gilgal  for there i hated them  for the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house  i will love them no more  all their princes  are  revolters  
16	ephraim is smitten  their root is dried up  they shall bear no fruit  yea  though they bring forth  yet will i slay  even  the beloved  fruit  of their womb  
17	my god will cast them away  because they did not hearken unto him  and they shall be wanderers among the nations  
hosea 10
1 	israel  is  an empty vine  he bringeth forth fruit unto himself  according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars  according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images  
2	their heart is divided  now shall they be found faulty  he shall break down their altars  he shall spoil their images  
3	for now they shall say  we have no king  because we feared not the lord  what then should a king do to us  
4	they have spoken words  swearing falsely in making a covenant  thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field  
5	the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of bethaven  for the people thereof shall mourn over it  and the priests thereof  that  rejoiced on it  for the glory thereof  because it is departed from it  
6	it shall be also carried unto assyria  for  a present to king jareb  ephraim shall receive shame  and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel  
7	 as for  samaria  her king is cut off as the foam upon the water  
8	the high places also of aven  the sin of israel  shall be destroyed  the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars  and they shall say to the mountains  cover us  and to the hills  fall on us  
9 	o israel  thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah  there they stood  the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them  
10	 it is  in my desire that i should chastise them  and the people shall be gathered against them  when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows  
11	and ephraim  is as  an heifer  that is  taught   and  loveth to tread out  the corn   but i passed over upon her fair neck  i will make ephraim to ride  judah shall plow   and  jacob shall break his clods  
12	sow to yourselves in righteousness  reap in mercy  break up your fallow ground  for  it is  time to seek the lord  till he come and rain righteousness upon you  
13	ye have plowed wickedness  ye have reaped iniquity  ye have eaten the fruit of lies  because thou didst trust in thy way  in the multitude of thy mighty men  
14	therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people  and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled  as shalman spoiled betharbel in the day of battle  the mother was dashed in pieces upon  her  children  
15	so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness  in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off

1 	when israel  was  a child  then i loved him  and called my son out of egypt  
2	 as  they called them  so they went from them  they sacrificed unto baalim  and burned incense to graven images  
3	i taught ephraim also to go  taking them by their arms  but they knew not that i healed them  
4	i drew them with cords of a man  with bands of love  and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws  and i laid meat unto them

8 	how shall i give thee up  ephraim   how  shall i deliver thee  israel  how shall i make thee as admah   how  shall i set thee as zeboim  mine heart is turned within me  my repentings are kindled together  
9	i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger  i will not return to destroy ephraim  for i  am  god  and not man  the holy one in the midst of thee  and i will not enter into the city  
10	they shall walk after the lord  he shall roar like a lion  when he shall roar  then the children shall tremble from the west  
11	they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt  and as a dove out of the land of assyria  and i will place them in their houses  saith the lord  
12	ephraim compasseth me about with lies  and the house of israel with deceit  but judah yet ruleth with god  and is faithful with the saints  
hosea 12
1 	ephraim feedeth on wind  and followeth after the east wind  he daily increaseth lies and desolation  and they do make a covenant with the assyrians  and oil is carried into egypt  
2	the lord hath also a controversy with judah  and will punish jacob according to his ways  according to his doings will he recompense him  
3	he took his brother by the heel in the womb  and by his strength he had power with god

5	even the lord god of hosts  the lord  is  his memorial  
6	therefore turn thou to thy god  keep mercy and judgment  and wait on thy god continually

9	and i  that am  the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles  as in the days of the solemn feast  
10	i have also spoken by the prophets  and i have multiplied visions  and used similitudes  by the ministry of the prophets  
11	 is there  iniquity  in  gilead  surely they are vanity  they sacrifice bullocks in gilgal  yea  their altars  are  as heaps in the furrows of the fields  
12	and jacob fled into the country of syria  and israel served for a wife  and for a wife he kept  sheep   
13	and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt  and by a prophet was he preserved

hosea 13
1 	when ephraim spake trembling  he exalted himself in israel  but when he offended in baal  he died  
2	and now they sin more and more  and have made them molten images of their silver   and  idols according to their own understanding  all of it the work of the craftsmen  they say of them  let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves  
3	therefore they shall be as the morning cloud  and as the early dew that passeth away  as the chaff  that  is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor  and as the smoke out of the chimney  
4	yet i  am  the lord thy god from the land of egypt  and thou shalt know no god but me  for  there is  no saviour beside me  
5 	i did know thee in the wilderness  in the land of great drought

17	the seed is rotten under their clods  the garners are laid desolate  the barns are broken down  for the corn is withered  
18	how do the beasts groan  the herds of cattle are perplexed  because they have no pasture  yea  the flocks of sheep are made desolate  
19	o lord  to thee will i cry  for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness  and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field  
20	the beasts of the field cry also unto thee  for the rivers of waters are dried up  and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness  
joel 2
1 	blow ye the trumpet in zion  and sound an alarm in my holy mountain  let all the inhabitants of the land tremble  for the day of the lord cometh  for  it is  nigh at hand  
2	a day of darkness and of gloominess  a day of clouds and of thick darkness  as the morning spread upon the mountains  a great people and a strong  there hath not been ever the like  neither shall be any more after it   even  to the years of many generations  
3	a fire devoureth before them  and behind them a flame burneth  the land  is  as the garden of eden before them  and behind them a desolate wilderness  yea  and nothing shall escape them  
4	the appearance of them  is  as the appearance of horses  and as horsemen  so shall they run  
5	like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap  like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble  as a strong people set in battle array  
6	before their face the people shall be much pained  all faces shall gather blackness  
7	they shall run like mighty men  they shall climb the wall like men of war  and they shall march every one on his ways  and they shall not break their ranks  
8	neither shall one thrust another  they shall walk every one in his path  and  when  they fall upon the sword  they shall not be wounded  
9	they shall run to and fro in the city  they shall run upon the wall  they shall climb up upon the houses  they shall enter in at the windows like a thief  
10	the earth shall quake before them  the heavens shall tremble  the sun and the moon shall be dark  and the stars shall withdraw their shining  
11	and the lord shall utter his voice before his army  for his camp  is  very great  for  he is  strong that executeth his word  for the day of the lord  is  great and very terrible  and who can abide it  
12 	therefore also now  saith the lord  turn ye  even  to me with all your heart  and with fasting  and with weeping  and with mourning  
13	and rend your heart  and not your garments  and turn unto the lord your god  for he  is  gracious and merciful  slow to anger  and of great kindness  and repenteth him of the evil  
14	who knoweth  if  he will return and repent  and leave a blessing behind him   even  a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord your god  
15	blow the trumpet in zion  sanctify a fast  call a solemn assembly  
16	gather the people  sanctify the congregation  assemble the elders  gather the children  and those that suck the breasts  let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber  and the bride out of her closet  
17	let the priests  the ministers of the lord  weep between the porch and the altar  and let them say  spare thy people  o lord  and give not thine heritage to reproach  that the heathen should rule over them  wherefore should they say among the people  where  is  their god  
18 	then will the lord be jealous for his land  and pity his people  
19	yea  the lord will answer and say unto his people  behold  i will send you corn  and wine  and oil  and ye shall be satisfied therewith  and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen  
20	but i will remove far off from you the northern  army   and will drive him into a land barren and desolate  with his face toward the east sea  and his hinder part toward the utmost sea  and his stink shall come up  and his ill savour shall come up  because he hath done great things  
21	fear not  o land  be glad and rejoice  for the lord will do great things  
22	be not afraid  ye beasts of the field  for the pastures of the wilderness do spring  for the tree beareth her fruit  the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength  
23	be glad then  ye children of zion  and rejoice in the lord your god  for he hath given you the former rain moderately  and he will cause to come down for you the rain  the former rain  and the latter rain in the first  month   
24	and the floors shall be full of wheat  and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil  
25	and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten  the cankerworm  and the caterpiller  and the palmerworm  my great army which i sent among you  
26	and ye shall eat in plenty  and be satisfied  and praise the name of the lord your god  that hath dealt wondrously with you  and my people shall never be ashamed  
27	and ye shall know that i  am  in the midst of israel  and  that  i  am  the lord your god  and none else  and my people shall never be ashamed  
28 	and it shall come to pass afterward   that  i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh  and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy  your old men shall dream dreams  your young men shall see visions  
29	and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit  
30	and i will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth  blood  and fire  and pillars of smoke  
31	the sun shall be turned into darkness  and the moon into blood  before the great and the terrible day of the lord come  
32	and it shall come to pass   that  whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered  for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance  as the lord hath said  and in the remnant whom the lord shall call  
joel 3
1 	for  behold  in those days  and in that time  when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem  
2	i will also gather all nations  and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat  and will plead with them there for my people and  for  my heritage israel  whom they have scattered among the nations  and parted my land  
3	and they have cast lots for my people  and have given a boy for an harlot  and sold a girl for wine  that they might drink  
4	yea  and what have ye to do with me  o tyre  and zidon  and all the coasts of palestine  will ye render me a recompence  and if ye recompense me  swiftly  and  speedily will i return your recompence upon your own head  
5	because ye have taken my silver and my gold  and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things  
6	the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto the grecians  that ye might remove them far from their border  
7	behold  i will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them  and will return your recompence upon your own head  
8	and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of judah  and they shall sell them to the sabeans  to a people far off  for the lord hath spoken  it   
9 	proclaim ye this among the gentiles  prepare war  wake up the mighty men  let all the men of war draw near  let them come up  
10	beat your plowshares into swords  and your pruninghooks into spears  let the weak say  i  am  strong  
11	assemble yourselves  and come  all ye heathen  and gather yourselves together round about  thither cause thy mighty ones to come down  o lord  
12	let the heathen be wakened  and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat  for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about  
13	put ye in the sickle  for the harvest is ripe  come  get you down  for the press is full  the fats overflow  for their wickedness  is  great  
14	multitudes  multitudes in the valley of decision  for the day of the lord  is  near in the valley of decision  
15	the sun and the moon shall be darkened  and the stars shall withdraw their shining  
16	the lord also shall roar out of zion  and utter his voice from jerusalem  and the heavens and the earth shall shake  but the lord  will be  the hope of his people  and the strength of the children of israel  
17	so shall ye know that i  am  the lord your god dwelling in zion  my holy mountain  then shall jerusalem be holy  and there shall no strangers pass through her any more  
18 	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the mountains shall drop down new wine  and the hills shall flow with milk  and all the rivers of judah shall flow with waters  and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the lord  and shall water the valley of shittim  
19	egypt shall be a desolation  and edom shall be a desolate wilderness  for the violence  against  the children of judah  because they have shed innocent blood in their land  
20	but judah shall dwell for ever  and jerusalem from generation to generation  
21	for i will cleanse their blood  that  i have not cleansed  for the lord dwelleth in zion  

amos
amos 1
1 	the words of amos  who was among the herdmen of tekoa  which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah  and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel  two years before the earthquake  
2	and he said  the lord will roar from zion  and utter his voice from jerusalem  and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn  and the top of carmel shall wither  
3 	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of damascus  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron  
4	but i will send a fire into the house of hazael  which shall devour the palaces of benhadad  
5	i will break also the bar of damascus  and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of aven  and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden  and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir  saith the lord  
6	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of gaza  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they carried away captive the whole captivity  to deliver  them  up to edom  
7	but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza  which shall devour the palaces thereof  
8	and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod  and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon  and i will turn mine hand against ekron  and the remnant of the philistines shall perish  saith the lord god  
9	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of tyrus  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they delivered up the whole captivity to edom  and remembered not the brotherly covenant  
10	but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus  which shall devour the palaces thereof  
11	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of edom  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because he did pursue his brother with the sword  and did cast off all pity  and his anger did tear perpetually  and he kept his wrath for ever  
12	but i will send a fire upon teman  which shall devour the palaces of bozrah  
13	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of the children of ammon  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead  that they might enlarge their border  
14	but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah  and it shall devour the palaces thereof  with shouting in the day of battle  with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind  
15	and their king shall go into captivity  he and his princes together  saith the lord  
amos 2
1 	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of moab  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime  
2	but i will send a fire upon moab  and it shall devour the palaces of kerioth  and moab shall die with tumult  with shouting   and  with the sound of the trumpet  
3	and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof  and will slay all the princes thereof with him  saith the lord  
4	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of judah  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they have despised the law of the lord  and have not kept his commandments  and their lies caused them to err  after the which their fathers have walked  
5	but i will send a fire upon judah  and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem  
6	thus saith the lord  for three transgressions of israel  and for four  i will not turn away  the punishment  thereof  because they sold the righteous for silver  and the poor for a pair of shoes  
7	that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor  and turn aside the way of the meek  and a man and his father will go in unto the  same  maid  to profane my holy name  
8	and they lay  themselves  down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar  and they drink the wine of the condemned  in  the house of their god  
9 	yet destroyed i the amorite before them  whose height  was  like the height of the cedars  and he  was  strong as the oaks  yet i destroyed his fruit from above  and his roots from beneath  
10	also i brought you up from the land of egypt  and led you forty years through the wilderness  to possess the land of the amorite  
11	and i raised up of your sons for prophets  and of your young men for nazarites   is it  not even thus  o ye children of israel  saith the lord  
12	but ye gave the nazarites wine to drink  and commanded the prophets  saying  prophesy not  
13	behold  i am pressed under you  as a cart is pressed  that is  full of sheaves  
14	therefore the flight shall perish from the swift  and the strong shall not strengthen his force  neither shall the mighty deliver himself  
15	neither shall he stand that handleth the bow  and  he that is  swift of foot shall not deliver  himself   neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself  
16	and  he that is  courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day  saith the lord  
amos 3
1 	hear this word that the lord hath spoken against you  o children of israel  against the whole family which i brought up from the land of egypt  saying  
2	you only have i known of all the families of the earth  therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities  
3	can two walk together  except they be agreed  
4	will a lion roar in the forest  when he hath no prey  will a young lion cry out of his den  if he have taken nothing  
5	can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth  where no gin  is  for him  shall  one  take up a snare from the earth  and have taken nothing at all  
6	shall a trumpet be blown in the city  and the people not be afraid  shall there be evil in a city  and the lord hath not done  it   
7	surely the lord god will do nothing  but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets  
8	the lion hath roared  who will not fear  the lord god hath spoken  who can but prophesy  
9 	publish in the palaces at ashdod  and in the palaces in the land of egypt  and say  assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria  and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof  and the oppressed in the midst thereof  
10	for they know not to do right  saith the lord  who store up violence and robbery in their palaces  
11	therefore thus saith the lord god  an adversary  there shall be  even round about the land  and he shall bring down thy strength from thee  and thy palaces shall be spoiled  
12	thus saith the lord  as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs  or a piece of an ear  so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed  and in damascus  in  a couch  
13	hear ye  and testify in the house of jacob  saith the lord god  the god of hosts  
14	that in the day that i shall visit the transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of bethel  and the horns of the altar shall be cut off  and fall to the ground  
15	and i will smite the winter house with the summer house  and the houses of ivory shall perish  and the great houses shall have an end  saith the lord  
amos 4
1 	hear this word  ye kine of bashan  that  are  in the mountain of samaria  which oppress the poor  which crush the needy  which say to their masters  bring  and let us drink  
2	the lord god hath sworn by his holiness  that  lo  the days shall come upon you  that he will take you away with hooks  and your posterity with fishhooks  
3	and ye shall go out at the breaches  every  cow at that which is  before her  and ye shall cast  them  into the palace  saith the lord  
4	come to bethel  and transgress  at gilgal multiply transgression  and bring your sacrifices every morning   and  your tithes after three years  
5	and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven  and proclaim  and  publish the free offerings  for this liketh you  o ye children of israel  saith the lord god  
6 	and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities  and want of bread in all your places  yet have ye not returned unto me  saith the lord  
7	and also i have withholden the rain from you  when  there were  yet three months to the harvest  and i caused it to rain upon one city  and caused it not to rain upon another city  one piece was rained upon  and the piece whereupon it rained not withered  
8	so two  or  three cities wandered unto one city  to drink water  but they were not satisfied  yet have ye not returned unto me  saith the lord  
9	i have smitten you with blasting and mildew  when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased  the palmerworm devoured  them   yet have ye not returned unto me  saith the lord  
10	i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt  your young men have i slain with the sword  and have taken away your horses  and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils  yet have ye not returned unto me  saith the lord  
11	i have overthrown  some  of you  as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah  and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning  yet have ye not returned unto me  saith the lord  
12	therefore thus will i do unto thee  o israel   and  because i will do this unto thee  prepare to meet thy god  o israel  
13	for  lo  he that formeth the mountains  and createth the wind  and declareth unto man what  is  his thought  that maketh the morning darkness  and treadeth upon the high places of the earth  the lord  the god of hosts   is  his name  
amos 5
1 	hear ye this word which i take up against you   even  a lamentation  o house of israel  
2	the virgin of israel is fallen  she shall no more rise  she is forsaken upon her land   there is  none to raise her up  
3	for thus saith the lord god  the city that went out  by  a thousand shall leave an hundred  and that which went forth  by  an hundred shall leave ten  to the house of israel  
4 	for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel  seek ye me  and ye shall live  
5	but seek not bethel  nor enter into gilgal  and pass not to beersheba  for gilgal shall surely go into captivity  and bethel shall come to nought  
6	seek the lord  and ye shall live  lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph  and devour  it   and  there be  none to quench  it  in bethel  
7	ye who turn judgment to wormwood  and leave off righteousness in the earth  
8	 seek him  that maketh the seven stars and orion  and turneth the shadow of death into the morning  and maketh the day dark with night  that calleth for the waters of the sea  and poureth them out upon the face of the earth  the lord  is  his name  
9	that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong  so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress  
10	they hate him that rebuketh in the gate  and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly  
11	forasmuch therefore as your treading  is  upon the poor  and ye take from him burdens of wheat  ye have built houses of hewn stone  but ye shall not dwell in them  ye have planted pleasant vineyards  but ye shall not drink wine of them  
12	for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins  they afflict the just  they take a bribe  and they turn aside the poor in the gate  from their right   
13	therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time  for it  is  an evil time  
14	seek good  and not evil  that ye may live  and so the lord  the god of hosts  shall be with you  as ye have spoken  
15	hate the evil  and love the good  and establish judgment in the gate  it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph  
16 	therefore the lord  the god of hosts  the lord  saith thus  wailing  shall be  in all streets  and they shall say in all the highways  alas  alas  and they shall call the husbandman to mourning  and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing  
17	and in all vineyards  shall be  wailing  for i will pass through thee  saith the lord  
18	woe unto you that desire the day of the lord  to what end  is  it for you  the day of the lord  is  darkness  and not light  
19	as if a man did flee from a lion  and a bear met him  or went into the house  and leaned his hand on the wall  and a serpent bit him  
20	 shall  not the day of the lord  be  darkness  and not light  even very dark  and no brightness in it  
21 	i hate  i despise your feast days  and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies  
22	though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings  i will not accept  them   neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts  
23	take thou away from me the noise of thy songs  for i will not hear the melody of thy viols  
24	but let judgment run down as waters  and righteousness as a mighty stream  
25	have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years  o house of israel  
26	but ye have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images  the star of your god  which ye made to yourselves  
27	therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus  saith the lord  whose name  is  the god of hosts  
amos 6
1 	woe to them  that are  at ease in zion  and trust in the mountain of samaria   which are  named chief of the nations  to whom the house of israel came  
2	pass ye unto calneh  and see  and from thence go ye to hamath the great  then go down to gath of the philistines   be they  better than these kingdoms  or their border greater than your border  
3	ye that put far away the evil day  and cause the seat of violence to come near  
4	that lie upon beds of ivory  and stretch themselves upon their couches  and eat the lambs out of the flock  and the calves out of the midst of the stall  
5	that chant to the sound of the viol   and  invent to themselves instruments of musick  like david  
6	that drink wine in bowls  and anoint themselves with the chief ointments  but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph  
7	therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive  and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed  
8 	the lord god hath sworn by himself  saith the lord the god of hosts  i abhor the excellency of jacob  and hate his palaces  therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein  
9	and it shall come to pass  if there remain ten men in one house  that they shall die  
10	and a man s uncle shall take him up  and he that burneth him  to bring out the bones out of the house  and shall say unto him that  is  by the sides of the house   is there  yet  any  with thee  and he shall say  no  then shall he say  hold thy tongue  for we may not make mention of the name of the lord  
11	for  behold  the lord commandeth  and he will smite the great house with breaches  and the little house with clefts  
12	shall horses run upon the rock  will  one  plow  there  with oxen  for ye have turned judgment into gall  and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock  
13	ye which rejoice in a thing of nought  which say  have we not taken to us horns by our own strength  
14	but  behold  i will raise up against you a nation  o house of israel  saith the lord the god of hosts  and they shall afflict you from the entering in of hemath unto the river of the wilderness  
amos 7
1 	thus hath the lord god shewed unto me  and  behold  he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth  and  lo   it was  the latter growth after the king s mowings  
2	and it came to pass   that  when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land  then i said  o lord god  forgive  i beseech thee  by whom shall jacob arise  for he  is  small  
3	the lord repented for this  it shall not be  saith the lord  
4	thus hath the lord god shewed unto me  and  behold  the lord god called to contend by fire  and it devoured the great deep  and did eat up a part  
5	then said i  o lord god  cease  i beseech thee  by whom shall jacob arise  for he  is  small  
6	the lord repented for this  this also shall not be  saith the lord god  
7	thus he shewed me  and  behold  the lord stood upon a wall  made  by a plumbline  with a plumbline in his hand  
8	and the lord said unto me  amos  what seest thou  and i said  a plumbline  then said the lord  behold  i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel  i will not again pass by them any more  
9	and the high places of isaac shall be desolate  and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste  and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword  
10 	then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel  saying  amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel  the land is not able to bear all his words  
11	for thus amos saith  jeroboam shall die by the sword  and israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land  
12	also amaziah said unto amos  o thou seer  go  flee thee away into the land of judah  and there eat bread  and prophesy there  
13	but prophesy not again any more at bethel  for it  is  the king s chapel  and it  is  the king s court  
14	then answered amos  and said to amaziah  i  was  no prophet  neither  was  i a prophet s son  but i  was  an herdman  and a gatherer of sycomore fruit  
15	and the lord took me as i followed the flock  and the lord said unto me  go  prophesy unto my people israel  
16	now therefore hear thou the word of the lord  thou sayest  prophesy not against israel  and drop not  thy word  against the house of isaac  
17	therefore thus saith the lord  thy wife shall be an harlot in the city  and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword  and thy land shall be divided by line  and thou shalt die in a polluted land  and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land  
amos 8
1 	thus hath the lord god shewed unto me  and behold a basket of summer fruit  
2	and he said  amos  what seest thou  and i said  a basket of summer fruit  then said the lord unto me  the end is come upon my people of israel  i will not again pass by them any more  
3	and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day  saith the lord god   there shall be  many dead bodies in every place  they shall cast  them  forth with silence  
4 	hear this  o ye that swallow up the needy  even to make the poor of the land to fail  
5	saying  when will the new moon be gone  that we may sell corn  and the sabbath  that we may set forth wheat  making the ephah small  and the shekel great  and falsifying the balances by deceit  
6	that we may buy the poor for silver  and the needy for a pair of shoes   yea   and sell the refuse of the wheat  
7	the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob  surely i will never forget any of their works  
8	shall not the land tremble for this  and every one mourn that dwelleth therein  and it shall rise up wholly as a flood  and it shall be cast out and drowned  as  by  the flood of egypt  
9	and it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord god  that i will cause the sun to go down at noon  and i will darken the earth in the clear day  
10	and i will turn your feasts into mourning  and all your songs into lamentation  and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins  and baldness upon every head  and i will make it as the mourning of an only  son   and the end thereof as a bitter day  
11 	behold  the days come  saith the lord god  that i will send a famine in the land  not a famine of bread  nor a thirst for water  but of hearing the words of the lord  
12	and they shall wander from sea to sea  and from the north even to the east  they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord  and shall not find  it   
13	in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst  
14	they that swear by the sin of samaria  and say  thy god  o dan  liveth  and  the manner of beersheba liveth  even they shall fall  and never rise up again  
amos 9
1 	i saw the lord standing upon the altar  and he said  smite the lintel of the door  that the posts may shake  and cut them in the head  all of them  and i will slay the last of them with the sword  he that fleeth of them shall not flee away  and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered  
2	though they dig into hell  thence shall mine hand take them  though they climb up to heaven  thence will i bring them down  
3	and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel  i will search and take them out thence  and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea  thence will i command the serpent  and he shall bite them  
4	and though they go into captivity before their enemies  thence will i command the sword  and it shall slay them  and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil  and not for good  
5	and the lord god of hosts  is  he that toucheth the land  and it shall melt  and all that dwell therein shall mourn  and it shall rise up wholly like a flood  and shall be drowned  as  by  the flood of egypt  
6	 it is  he that buildeth his stories in the heaven  and hath founded his troop in the earth  he that calleth for the waters of the sea  and poureth them out upon the face of the earth  the lord  is  his name  
7	 are  ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me  o children of israel  saith the lord  have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt  and the philistines from caphtor  and the syrians from kir  
8	behold  the eyes of the lord god  are  upon the sinful kingdom  and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth  saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob  saith the lord  
9	for  lo  i will command  and i will sift the house of israel among all nations  like as  corn  is sifted in a sieve  yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth  
10	all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword  which say  the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us  
11 	in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen  and close up the breaches thereof  and i will raise up his ruins  and i will build it as in the days of old  
12	that they may possess the remnant of edom  and of all the heathen  which are called by my name  saith the lord that doeth this  
13	behold  the days come  saith the lord  that the plowman shall overtake the reaper  and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed  and the mountains shall drop sweet wine  and all the hills shall melt  
14	and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel  and they shall build the waste cities  and inhabit  them   and they shall plant vineyards  and drink the wine thereof  they shall also make gardens  and eat the fruit of them  
15	and i will plant them upon their land  and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which i have given them  saith the lord thy god  

obadiah
obadiah 1
1 	the vision of obadiah  thus saith the lord god concerning edom  we have heard a rumour from the lord  and an ambassador is sent among the heathen  arise ye  and let us rise up against her in battle  
2	behold  i have made thee small among the heathen  thou art greatly despised  
3	the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee  thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock  whose habitation  is  high  that saith in his heart  who shall bring me down to the ground  
4	though thou exalt  thyself  as the eagle  and though thou set thy nest among the stars  thence will i bring thee down  saith the lord  
5	if thieves came to thee  if robbers by night   how art thou cut off   would they not have stolen till they had enough  if the grapegatherers came to thee  would they not leave  some  grapes  
6	how are  the things  of esau searched out   how  are his hidden things sought up  
7	all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee  even  to the border  the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee   and  prevailed against thee   they that eat  thy bread have laid a wound under thee   there is  none understanding in him  
8	shall i not in that day  saith the lord  even destroy the wise  men  out of edom  and understanding out of the mount of esau  
9	and thy mighty  men   o teman  shall be dismayed  to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter  
10 	for  thy  violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee  and thou shalt be cut off for ever  
11	in the day that thou stoodest on the other side  in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces  and foreigners entered into his gates  and cast lots upon jerusalem  even thou  wast  as one of them  
12	but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger  neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction  neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress  
13	thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity  yea  thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity  nor have laid  hands  on their substance in the day of their calamity  
14	neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway  to cut off those of his that did escape  neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress  
15	for the day of the lord  is  near upon all the heathen  as thou hast done  it shall be done unto thee  thy reward shall return upon thine own head  
16	for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain   so  shall all the heathen drink continually  yea  they shall drink  and they shall swallow down  and they shall be as though they had not been  
17 	but upon mount zion shall be deliverance  and there shall be holiness  and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions  
18	and the house of jacob shall be a fire  and the house of joseph a flame  and the house of esau for stubble  and they shall kindle in them  and devour them  and there shall not be  any  remaining of the house of esau  for the lord hath spoken  it   
19	and  they of  the south shall possess the mount of esau  and  they of  the plain the philistines  and they shall possess the fields of ephraim  and the fields of samaria  and benjamin  shall possess  gilead  
20	and the captivity of this host of the children of israel  shall possess  that of the canaanites   even  unto zarephath  and the captivity of jerusalem  which  is  in sepharad  shall possess the cities of the south  
21	and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau  and the kingdom shall be the lord s  

jonah
jonah 1
1 	now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai  saying  
2	arise  go to nineveh  that great city  and cry against it  for their wickedness is come up before me  
3	but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord  and went down to joppa  and he found a ship going to tarshish  so he paid the fare thereof  and went down into it  to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord  
4 	but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea  and there was a mighty tempest in the sea  so that the ship was like to be broken  
5	then the mariners were afraid  and cried every man unto his god  and cast forth the wares that  were  in the ship into the sea  to lighten  it  of them  but jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship  and he lay  and was fast asleep  
6	so the shipmaster came to him  and said unto him  what meanest thou  o sleeper  arise  call upon thy god  if so be that god will think upon us  that we perish not  
7	and they said every one to his fellow  come  and let us cast lots  that we may know for whose cause this evil  is  upon us  so they cast lots  and the lot fell upon jonah  
8	then said they unto him  tell us  we pray thee  for whose cause this evil  is  upon us  what  is  thine occupation  and whence comest thou  what  is  thy country  and of what people  art  thou  
9	and he said unto them  i  am  an hebrew  and i fear the lord  the god of heaven  which hath made the sea and the dry  land   
10	then were the men exceedingly afraid  and said unto him  why hast thou done this  for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord  because he had told them  
11 	then said they unto him  what shall we do unto thee  that the sea may be calm unto us  for the sea wrought  and was tempestuous  
12	and he said unto them  take me up  and cast me forth into the sea  so shall the sea be calm unto you  for i know that for my sake this great tempest  is  upon you  
13	nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring  it  to the land  but they could not  for the sea wrought  and was tempestuous against them  
14	wherefore they cried unto the lord  and said  we beseech thee  o lord  we beseech thee  let us not perish for this man s life  and lay not upon us innocent blood  for thou  o lord  hast done as it pleased thee  
15	so they took up jonah  and cast him forth into the sea  and the sea ceased from her raging  
16	then the men feared the lord exceedingly  and offered a sacrifice unto the lord  and made vows  
17	now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah  and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights  
jonah 2
1 	then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish s belly  
2	and said  i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord  and he heard me  out of the belly of hell cried i   and  thou heardest my voice  
3	for thou hadst cast me into the deep  in the midst of the seas  and the floods compassed me about  all thy billows and thy waves passed over me  
4	then i said  i am cast out of thy sight  yet i will look again toward thy holy temple  
5	the waters compassed me about   even  to the soul  the depth closed me round about  the weeds were wrapped about my head  
6	i went down to the bottoms of the mountains  the earth with her bars  was  about me for ever  yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption  o lord my god  
7	when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord  and my prayer came in unto thee  into thine holy temple  
8	they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy  
9	but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving  i will pay  that  that i have vowed  salvation  is  of the lord  
10 	and the lord spake unto the fish  and it vomited out jonah upon the dry  land   
jonah 3
1 	and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time  saying  
2	arise  go unto nineveh  that great city  and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee  
3	so jonah arose  and went unto nineveh  according to the word of the lord  now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days  journey  
4	and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey  and he cried  and said  yet forty days  and nineveh shall be overthrown  
5 	so the people of nineveh believed god  and proclaimed a fast  and put on sackcloth  from the greatest of them even to the least of them  
6	for word came unto the king of nineveh  and he arose from his throne  and he laid his robe from him  and covered  him  with sackcloth  and sat in ashes  
7	and he caused  it  to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles  saying  let neither man nor beast  herd nor flock  taste any thing  let them not feed  nor drink water  
8	but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth  and cry mightily unto god  yea  let them turn every one from his evil way  and from the violence that  is  in their hands  
9	who can tell  if  god will turn and repent  and turn away from his fierce anger  that we perish not  
10	and god saw their works  that they turned from their evil way  and god repented of the evil  that he had said that he would do unto them  and he did  it  not  
jonah 4
1 	but it displeased jonah exceedingly  and he was very angry  
2	and he prayed unto the lord  and said  i pray thee  o lord   was  not this my saying  when i was yet in my country  therefore i fled before unto tarshish  for i knew that thou  art  a gracious god  and merciful  slow to anger  and of great kindness  and repentest thee of the evil  
3	therefore now  o lord  take  i beseech thee  my life from me  for  it is  better for me to die than to live  
4	then said the lord  doest thou well to be angry  
5 	so jonah went out of the city  and sat on the east side of the city  and there made him a booth  and sat under it in the shadow  till he might see what would become of the city  
6	and the lord god prepared a gourd  and made  it  to come up over jonah  that it might be a shadow over his head  to deliver him from his grief  so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd  
7	but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day  and it smote the gourd that it withered  
8	and it came to pass  when the sun did arise  that god prepared a vehement east wind  and the sun beat upon the head of jonah  that he fainted  and wished in himself to die  and said   it is  better for me to die than to live  
9	and god said to jonah  doest thou well to be angry for the gourd  and he said  i do well to be angry   even  unto death  
10	then said the lord  thou hast had pity on the gourd  for the which thou hast not laboured  neither madest it grow  which came up in a night  and perished in a night  
11	and should not i spare nineveh  that great city  wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand  and  also  much cattle  

micah
micah 1
1 	the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the days of jotham  ahaz   and  hezekiah  kings of judah  which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem  
2	hear  all ye people  hearken  o earth  and all that therein is  and let the lord god be witness against you  the lord from his holy temple  
3	for  behold  the lord cometh forth out of his place  and will come down  and tread upon the high places of the earth  
4	and the mountains shall be molten under him  and the valleys shall be cleft  as wax before the fire   and  as the waters  that are  poured down a steep place  
5	for the transgression of jacob  is  all this  and for the sins of the house of israel  what  is  the transgression of jacob   is it  not samaria  and what  are  the high places of judah   are they  not jerusalem  
6	therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field   and  as plantings of a vineyard  and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley  and i will discover the foundations thereof  
7	and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces  and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire  and all the idols thereof will i lay desolate  for she gathered  it  of the hire of an harlot  and they shall return to the hire of an harlot  
8 	therefore i will wail and howl  i will go stripped and naked  i will make a wailing like the dragons  and mourning as the owls  
9	for her wound  is  incurable  for it is come unto judah  he is come unto the gate of my people   even  to jerusalem  
10	declare ye  it  not at gath  weep ye not at all  in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust  
11	pass ye away  thou inhabitant of saphir  having thy shame naked  the inhabitant of zaanan came not forth in the mourning of bethezel  he shall receive of you his standing  
12	for the inhabitant of maroth waited carefully for good  but evil came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem  
13	o thou inhabitant of lachish  bind the chariot to the swift beast  she  is  the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion  for the transgressions of israel were found in thee  
14	therefore shalt thou give presents to moreshethgath  the houses of achzib  shall be  a lie to the kings of israel  
15	yet will i bring an heir unto thee  o inhabitant of mareshah  he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel  
16	make thee bald  and poll thee for thy delicate children  enlarge thy baldness as the eagle  for they are gone into captivity from thee  
micah 2
1 	woe to them that devise iniquity  and work evil upon their beds  when the morning is light  they practise it  because it is in the power of their hand  
2	and they covet fields  and take  them  by violence  and houses  and take  them  away  so they oppress a man and his house  even a man and his heritage  
3	therefore thus saith the lord  behold  against this family do i devise an evil  from which ye shall not remove your necks  neither shall ye go haughtily  for this time  is  evil  
4	in that day shall  one  take up a parable against you  and lament with a doleful lamentation   and  say  we be utterly spoiled  he hath changed the portion of my people  how hath he removed  it  from me  turning away he hath divided our fields  
5	therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord  
6 	prophesy ye not   say they to them that  prophesy  they shall not prophesy to them   that  they shall not take shame  
7	o  thou that art  named the house of jacob  is the spirit of the lord straitened   are  these his doings  do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly  
8	even of late my people is risen up as an enemy  ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war  
9	the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses  from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever  
10	arise ye  and depart  for this  is  not  your  rest  because it is polluted  it shall destroy  you   even with a sore destruction  
11	if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie   saying   i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink  he shall even be the prophet of this people  
12 	i will surely assemble  o jacob  all of thee  i will surely gather the remnant of israel  i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah  as the flock in the midst of their fold  they shall make great noise by reason of  the multitude of  men  
13	the breaker is come up before them  they have broken up  and have passed through the gate  and are gone out by it  and their king shall pass before them  and the lord on the head of them  
micah 3
1 	and i said  hear  i pray you  o heads of jacob  and ye princes of the house of israel   is it  not for you to know judgment  
2	who hate the good  and love the evil  who pluck off their skin from off them  and their flesh from off their bones  
3	who also eat the flesh of my people  and flay their skin from off them  and they break their bones  and chop them in pieces  as for the pot  and as flesh within the caldron  
4	then shall they cry unto the lord  but he will not hear them  he will even hide his face from them at that time  as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings  
5	thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people err  that bite with their teeth  and cry  peace  and he that putteth not into their mouths  they even prepare war against him  
6	therefore night  shall be  unto you  that ye shall not have a vision  and it shall be dark unto you  that ye shall not divine  and the sun shall go down over the prophets  and the day shall be dark over them  
7	then shall the seers be ashamed  and the diviners confounded  yea  they shall all cover their lips  for  there is  no answer of god  
8 	but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord  and of judgment  and of might  to declare unto jacob his transgression  and to israel his sin  
9	hear this  i pray you  ye heads of the house of jacob  and princes of the house of israel  that abhor judgment  and pervert all equity  
10	they build up zion with blood  and jerusalem with iniquity  
11	the heads thereof judge for reward  and the priests thereof teach for hire  and the prophets thereof divine for money  yet will they lean upon the lord  and say   is  not the lord among us  none evil can come upon us  
12	therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed  as  a field  and jerusalem shall become heaps  and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest  
micah 4
1 	but in the last days it shall come to pass   that  the mountain of the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains  and it shall be exalted above the hills  and people shall flow unto it  
2	and many nations shall come  and say  come  and let us go up to the mountain of the lord  and to the house of the god of jacob  and he will teach us of his ways  and we will walk in his paths  for the law shall go forth of zion  and the word of the lord from jerusalem  
3	and he shall judge among many people  and rebuke strong nations afar off  and they shall beat their swords into plowshares  and their spears into pruninghooks  nation shall not lift up a sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more  
4	but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree  and none shall make  them  afraid  for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken  it   
5	for all people will walk every one in the name of his god  and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever  
6	in that day  saith the lord  will i assemble her that halteth  and i will gather her that is driven out  and her that i have afflicted  
7	and i will make her that halted a remnant  and her that was cast far off a strong nation  and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion from henceforth  even for ever  
8 	and thou  o tower of the flock  the strong hold of the daughter of zion  unto thee shall it come  even the first dominion  the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem  
9	now why dost thou cry out aloud   is there  no king in thee  is thy counsellor perished  for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail  
10	be in pain  and labour to bring forth  o daughter of zion  like a woman in travail  for now shalt thou go forth out of the city  and thou shalt dwell in the field  and thou shalt go  even  to babylon  there shalt thou be delivered  there the lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies  
11	now also many nations are gathered against thee  that say  let her be defiled  and let our eye look upon zion  
12	but they know not the thoughts of the lord  neither understand they his counsel  for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor  
13	arise and thresh  o daughter of zion  for i will make thine horn iron  and i will make thy hoofs brass  and thou shalt beat in pieces many people  and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord  and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth  
micah 5
1 	now gather thyself in troops  o daughter of troops  he hath laid siege against us  they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek  
2	but thou  bethlehem ephratah   though  thou be little among the thousands of judah   yet  out of thee shall he come forth unto me  that is  to be ruler in israel  whose goings forth  have been  from of old  from everlasting  
3	therefore will he give them up  until the time  that  she which travaileth hath brought forth  then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel  
4	and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord  in the majesty of the name of the lord his god  and they shall abide  for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth  
5	and this  man  shall be the peace  when the assyrian shall come into our land  and when he shall tread in our palaces  then shall we raise against him seven shepherds  and eight principal men  
6	and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword  and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof  thus shall he deliver  us  from the assyrian  when he cometh into our land  and when he treadeth within our borders  
7 	and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord  as the showers upon the grass  that tarrieth not for man  nor waiteth for the sons of men  
8	and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest  as a young lion among the flocks of sheep  who  if he go through  both treadeth down  and teareth in pieces  and none can deliver  
9	thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries  and all thine enemies shall be cut off  
10	and it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord  that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee  and i will destroy thy chariots  
11	and i will cut off the cities of thy land  and throw down all thy strong holds  
12	and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand  and thou shalt have no  more  soothsayers  
13	thy graven images also will i cut off  and thy standing images out of the midst of thee  and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands  
14	and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee  so will i destroy thy cities  
15	and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen  such as they have not heard  
micah 6
1 	hear ye now what the lord saith  arise  contend thou before the mountains  and let the hills hear thy voice  
2	hear ye  o mountains  the lord s controversy  and ye strong foundations of the earth  for the lord hath a controversy with his people  and he will plead with israel  
3	o my people  what have i done unto thee  and wherein have i wearied thee  testify against me  
4	for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt  and redeemed thee out of the house of servants  and i sent before thee moses  aaron  and miriam  
5	o my people  remember now what balak king of moab consulted  and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal  that ye may know the righteousness of the lord  
6 	wherewith shall i come before the lord   and  bow myself before the high god  shall i come before him with burnt offerings  with calves of a year old  
7	will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams   or  with ten thousands of rivers of oil  shall i give my firstborn  for  my transgression  the fruit of my body  for  the sin of my soul  
8	he hath shewed thee  o man  what  is  good  and what doth the lord require of thee  but to do justly  and to love mercy  and to walk humbly with thy god  
9 	the lord s voice crieth unto the city  and  the man of  wisdom shall see thy name  hear ye the rod  and who hath appointed it  
10	are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked  and the scant measure  that is  abominable  
11	shall i count  them  pure with the wicked balances  and with the bag of deceitful weights  
12	for the rich men thereof are full of violence  and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies  and their tongue  is  deceitful in their mouth  
13	therefore also will i make  thee  sick in smiting thee  in making  thee  desolate because of thy sins  
14	thou shalt eat  but not be satisfied  and thy casting down  shall be  in the midst of thee  and thou shalt take hold  but shalt not deliver  and  that  which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword  
15	thou shalt sow  but thou shalt not reap  thou shalt tread the olives  but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil  and sweet wine  but shalt not drink wine  
16	for the statutes of omri are kept  and all the works of the house of ahab  and ye walk in their counsels  that i should make thee a desolation  and the inhabitants thereof an hissing  therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people  
micah 7
1 	woe is me  for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits  as the grapegleanings of the vintage   there is  no cluster to eat  my soul desired the firstripe fruit  
2	the good  man  is perished out of the earth  and  there is  none upright among men  they all lie in wait for blood  they hunt every man his brother with a net  
3	that they may do evil with both hands earnestly  the prince asketh  and the judge  asketh  for a reward  and the great  man   he uttereth his mischievous desire  so they wrap it up  
4	the best of them  is  as a brier  the most upright  is sharper  than a thorn hedge  the day of thy watchmen  and  thy visitation cometh  now shall be their perplexity  
5	trust ye not in a friend  put ye not confidence in a guide  keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom  
6	for the son dishonoureth the father  the daughter riseth up against her mother  the daughter in law against her mother in law  a man s enemies  are  the men of his own house  
7 	therefore i will look unto the lord  i will wait for the god of my salvation  my god will hear me  
8	rejoice not against me  o mine enemy  when i fall  i shall arise  when i sit in darkness  the lord  shall be  a light unto me  
9	i will bear the indignation of the lord  because i have sinned against him  until he plead my cause  and execute judgment for me  he will bring me forth to the light   and  i shall behold his righteousness  
10	then  she that is  mine enemy shall see  it   and shame shall cover her which said unto me  where is the lord thy god  mine eyes shall behold her  now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets  
11	 in  the day that thy walls are to be built   in  that day shall the decree be far removed  
12	 in  that day  also  he shall come even to thee from assyria  and  from  the fortified cities  and from the fortress even to the river  and from sea to sea  and  from  mountain to mountain  
13	notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein  for the fruit of their doings

16	the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might  they shall lay  their  hand upon  their  mouth  their ears shall be deaf  
17	they shall lick the dust like a serpent  they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth  they shall be afraid of the lord our god  and shall fear because of thee  
18	who  is  a god like unto thee  that pardoneth iniquity  and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage  he retaineth not his anger for ever  because he delighteth  in  mercy  
19	he will turn again  he will have compassion upon us  he will subdue our iniquities  and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea  
20	thou wilt perform the truth to jacob   and  the mercy to abraham  which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old

2	o lord  how long shall i cry  and thou wilt not hear   even  cry out unto thee  of  violence  and thou wilt not save  
3	why dost thou shew me iniquity  and cause  me  to behold grievance  for spoiling and violence  are  before me  and there are  that  raise up strife and contention  
4	therefore the law is slacked  and judgment doth never go forth  for the wicked doth compass about the righteous  therefore wrong judgment proceedeth  
5 	behold ye among the heathen  and regard  and wonder marvellously  for  i  will work a work in your days   which  ye will not believe  though it be told  you   
6	for  lo  i raise up the chaldeans   that  bitter and hasty nation  which shall march through the breadth of the land  to possess the dwellingplaces  that are  not theirs  
7	they  are  terrible and dreadful  their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves  
8	their horses also are swifter than the leopards  and are more fierce than the evening wolves  and their horsemen shall spread themselves  and their horsemen shall come from far  they shall fly as the eagle  that  hasteth to eat  
9	they shall come all for violence  their faces shall sup up  as  the east wind  and they shall gather the captivity as the sand  
10	and they shall scoff at the kings  and the princes shall be a scorn unto them  they shall deride every strong hold  for they shall heap dust  and take it  
11	then shall  his  mind change  and he shall pass over  and offend   imputing  this his power unto his god  
12 	 art  thou not from everlasting  o lord my god  mine holy one  we shall not die  o lord  thou hast ordained them for judgment  and  o mighty god  thou hast established them for correction  
13	 thou art  of purer eyes than to behold evil  and canst not look on iniquity  wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously   and  holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth  the man that is  more righteous than he  
14	and makest men as the fishes of the sea  as the creeping things   that have  no ruler over them  
15	they take up all of them with the angle  they catch them in their net  and gather them in their drag  therefore they rejoice and are glad  
16	therefore they sacrifice unto their net  and burn incense unto their drag  because by them their portion  is  fat  and their meat plenteous  
17	shall they therefore empty their net  and not spare continually to slay the nations

9	woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house  that he may set his nest on high  that he may be delivered from the power of evil  
10	thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people  and hast sinned  against  thy soul

7	i saw the tents of cushan in affliction   and  the curtains of the land of midian did tremble  
8	was the lord displeased against the rivers   was  thine anger against the rivers   was  thy wrath against the sea  that thou didst ride upon thine horses  and  thy chariots of salvation  
9	thy bow was made quite naked   according  to the oaths of the tribes   even thy  word  selah  thou didst cleave the earth with rivers  
10	the mountains saw thee   and  they trembled  the overflowing of the water passed by  the deep uttered his voice   and  lifted up his hands on high  
11	the sun  and  moon stood still in their habitation  at the light of thine arrows they went   and  at the shining of thy glittering spear  
12	thou didst march through the land in indignation  thou didst thresh the heathen in anger  
13	thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people   even  for salvation with thine anointed  thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked  by discovering the foundation unto the neck  selah  
14	thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages  they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me  their rejoicing  was  as to devour the poor secretly  
15	thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses   through  the heap of great waters  
16 	when i heard  my belly trembled  my lips quivered at the voice  rottenness entered into my bones  and i trembled in myself  that i might rest in the day of trouble  when he cometh up unto the people  he will invade them with his troops  
17	although the fig tree shall not blossom  neither  shall  fruit  be  in the vines  the labour of the olive shall fail  and the fields shall yield no meat  the flock shall be cut off from the fold  and  there shall be  no herd in the stalls  
18	yet i will rejoice in the lord  i will joy in the god of my salvation

11	howl  ye inhabitants of maktesh  for all the merchant people are cut down  all they that bear silver are cut off  
12	and it shall come to pass at that time   that  i will search jerusalem with candles  and punish the men that are settled on their lees  that say in their heart  the lord will not do good  neither will he do evil  
13	therefore their goods shall become a booty  and their houses a desolation  they shall also build houses  but not inhabit  them   and they shall plant vineyards  but not drink the wine thereof  
14 	the great day of the lord  is  near   it is  near  and hasteth greatly   even  the voice of the day of the lord  the mighty man shall cry there bitterly  
15	that day  is  a day of wrath  a day of trouble and distress  a day of wasteness and desolation  a day of darkness and gloominess  a day of clouds and thick darkness  
16	a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities  and against the high towers  
17	and i will bring distress upon men  that they shall walk like blind men  because they have sinned against the lord  and their blood shall be poured out as dust  and their flesh as the dung

1 	in the second year of darius the king  in the sixth month  in the first day of the month  came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  governor of judah  and to joshua the son of josedech  the high priest  saying  
2	thus speaketh the lord of hosts  saying  this people say  the time is not come  the time that the lord s house should be built  
3	then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet  saying  
4	 is it  time for you  o ye  to dwell in your cieled houses  and this house  lie  waste  
5	now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts  consider your ways  
6	ye have sown much  and bring in little  ye eat  but ye have not enough  ye drink  but ye are not filled with drink  ye clothe you  but there is none warm  and he that earneth wages earneth wages  to put it  into a bag with holes  
7	thus saith the lord of hosts  consider your ways  
8	go up to the mountain  and bring wood  and build the house  and i will take pleasure in it  and i will be glorified  saith the lord  
9	ye looked for much  and  lo   it came  to little  and when ye brought  it  home  i did blow upon it  why  saith the lord of hosts  because of mine house that  is  waste  and ye run every man unto his own house  
10	therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew  and the earth is stayed  from  her fruit  
11	and i called for a drought upon the land  and upon the mountains  and upon the corn  and upon the new wine  and upon the oil  and upon  that  which the ground bringeth forth  and upon men  and upon cattle  and upon all the labour of the hands  
12 	then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and joshua the son of josedech  the high priest  with all the remnant of the people  obeyed the voice of the lord their god  and the words of haggai the prophet  as the lord their god had sent him  and the people did fear before the lord  
13	then spake haggai the lord s messenger in the lord s message unto the people  saying  i  am  with you  saith the lord  
14	and the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  governor of judah  and the spirit of joshua the son of josedech  the high priest  and the spirit of all the remnant of the people  and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts  their god

2	speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  governor of judah  and to joshua the son of josedech  the high priest  and to the residue of the people  saying  
3	who  is  left among you that saw this house in her first glory  and how do ye see it now   is it  not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing  
4	yet now be strong  o zerubbabel  saith the lord  and be strong  o joshua  son of josedech  the high priest  and be strong  all ye people of the land  saith the lord  and work  for i  am  with you  saith the lord of hosts  
5	 according to  the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt  so my spirit remaineth among you  fear ye not  
6	for thus saith the lord of hosts  yet once  it  is  a little while  and i will shake the heavens  and the earth  and the sea  and the dry  land   
7	and i will shake all nations  and the desire of all nations shall come  and i will fill this house with glory  saith the lord of hosts  
8	the silver  is  mine  and the gold  is  mine  saith the lord of hosts  
9	the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former  saith the lord of hosts  and in this place will i give peace  saith the lord of hosts  
10 	in the four and twentieth  day  of the ninth  month   in the second year of darius  came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet  saying  
11	thus saith the lord of hosts  ask now the priests  concerning  the law  saying  
12	if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment  and with his skirt do touch bread  or pottage  or wine  or oil  or any meat  shall it be holy  and the priests answered and said  no  
13	then said haggai  if  one that is  unclean by a dead body touch any of these  shall it be unclean  and the priests answered and said  it shall be unclean  
14	then answered haggai  and said  so  is  this people  and so  is  this nation before me  saith the lord  and so  is  every work of their hands  and that which they offer there  is  unclean  
15	and now  i pray you  consider from this day and upward  from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord  
16	since those  days  were  when  one  came to an heap of twenty  measures   there were  but  ten  when  one  came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty  vessels  out of the press  there were  but  twenty  
17	i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands  yet ye  turned  not to me  saith the lord  
18	consider now from this day and upward  from the four and twentieth day of the ninth  month  even  from the day that the foundation of the lord s temple was laid  consider  it   
19	is the seed yet in the barn  yea  as yet the vine  and the fig tree  and the pomegranate  and the olive tree  hath not brought forth  from this day will i bless  you   
20 	and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and twentieth  day  of the month  saying  
21	speak to zerubbabel  governor of judah  saying  i will shake the heavens and the earth  
22	and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms  and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen  and i will overthrow the chariots  and those that ride in them  and the horses and their riders shall come down  every one by the sword of his brother  
23	in that day  saith the lord of hosts  will i take thee  o zerubbabel  my servant  the son of shealtiel  saith the lord  and will make thee as a signet  for i have chosen thee  saith the lord of hosts  

zechariah
zechariah 1
1 	in the eighth month  in the second year of darius  came the word of the lord unto zechariah  the son of berechiah  the son of iddo the prophet  saying  
2	the lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers  
3	therefore say thou unto them  thus saith the lord of hosts  turn ye unto me  saith the lord of hosts  and i will turn unto you  saith the lord of hosts  
4	be ye not as your fathers  unto whom the former prophets have cried  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  turn ye now from your evil ways  and  from  your evil doings  but they did not hear  nor hearken unto me  saith the lord  
5	your fathers  where  are  they  and the prophets  do they live for ever  
6	but my words and my statutes  which i commanded my servants the prophets  did they not take hold of your fathers  and they returned and said  like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us  according to our ways  and according to our doings  so hath he dealt with us  
7 	upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month  which  is  the month sebat  in the second year of darius  came the word of the lord unto zechariah  the son of berechiah  the son of iddo the prophet  saying  
8	i saw by night  and behold a man riding upon a red horse  and he stood among the myrtle trees that  were  in the bottom  and behind him  were there  red horses  speckled  and white  
9	then said i  o my lord  what  are  these  and the angel that talked with me said unto me  i will shew thee what these  be   
10	and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said  these  are they  whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth  
11	and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees  and said  we have walked to and fro through the earth  and  behold  all the earth sitteth still  and is at rest  
12	then the angel of the lord answered and said  o lord of hosts  how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah  against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years  
13	and the lord answered the angel that talked with me  with  good words  and  comfortable words  
14	so the angel that communed with me said unto me  cry thou  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy  
15	and i am very sore displeased with the heathen  that are  at ease  for i was but a little displeased  and they helped forward the affliction  
16	therefore thus saith the lord  i am returned to jerusalem with mercies  my house shall be built in it  saith the lord of hosts  and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem  
17	cry yet  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  my cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad  and the lord shall yet comfort zion  and shall yet choose jerusalem  
18 	then lifted i up mine eyes  and saw  and behold four horns  
19	and i said unto the angel that talked with me  what  be  these  and he answered me  these  are  the horns which have scattered judah  israel  and jerusalem  
20	and the lord shewed me four carpenters  
21	then said i  what come these to do  and he spake  saying  these  are  the horns which have scattered judah  so that no man did lift up his head  but these are come to fray them  to cast out the horns of the gentiles  which lifted up  their  horn over the land of judah to scatter it  
zechariah 2
1 	i lifted up mine eyes again  and looked  and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand  
2	then said i  whither goest thou  and he said unto me  to measure jerusalem  to see what  is  the breadth thereof  and what  is  the length thereof  
3	and  behold  the angel that talked with me went forth  and another angel went out to meet him  
4	and said unto him  run  speak to this young man  saying  jerusalem shall be inhabited  as  towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein  
5	for i  saith the lord  will be unto her a wall of fire round about  and will be the glory in the midst of her  
6 	ho  ho   come forth   and flee from the land of the north  saith the lord  for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven  saith the lord  
7	deliver thyself  o zion  that dwellest  with  the daughter of babylon  
8	for thus saith the lord of hosts  after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you  for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye  
9	for  behold  i will shake mine hand upon them  and they shall be a spoil to their servants  and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me  
10 	sing and rejoice  o daughter of zion  for  lo  i come  and i will dwell in the midst of thee  saith the lord  
11	and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day  and shall be my people  and i will dwell in the midst of thee  and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee  
12	and the lord shall inherit judah his portion in the holy land  and shall choose jerusalem again  
13	be silent  o all flesh  before the lord  for he is raised up out of his holy habitation  
zechariah 3
1 	and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord  and satan standing at his right hand to resist him  
2	and the lord said unto satan  the lord rebuke thee  o satan  even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee   is  not this a brand plucked out of the fire  
3	now joshua was clothed with filthy garments  and stood before the angel  
4	and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him  saying  take away the filthy garments from him  and unto him he said  behold  i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee  and i will clothe thee with change of raiment  
5	and i said  let them set a fair mitre upon his head  so they set a fair mitre upon his head  and clothed him with garments  and the angel of the lord stood by  
6	and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua  saying  
7	thus saith the lord of hosts  if thou wilt walk in my ways  and if thou wilt keep my charge  then thou shalt also judge my house  and shalt also keep my courts  and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by  
8 	hear now  o joshua the high priest  thou  and thy fellows that sit before thee  for they  are  men wondered at  for  behold  i will bring forth my servant the branch  
9	for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua  upon one stone  shall be  seven eyes  behold  i will engrave the graving thereof  saith the lord of hosts  and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day  
10	in that day  saith the lord of hosts  shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree  
zechariah 4
1 	and the angel that talked with me came again  and waked me  as a man that is wakened out of his sleep  
2	and said unto me  what seest thou  and i said  i have looked  and behold a candlestick all  of  gold  with a bowl upon the top of it  and his seven lamps thereon  and seven pipes to the seven lamps  which  are  upon the top thereof  
3	and two olive trees by it  one upon the right  side  of the bowl  and the other upon the left  side  thereof  
4	so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me  saying  what  are  these  my lord  
5	then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me  knowest thou not what these be  and i said  no  my lord  
6	then he answered and spake unto me  saying  this  is  the word of the lord unto zerubbabel  saying  not by might  nor by power  but by my spirit  saith the lord of hosts  
7	who  art  thou  o great mountain  before zerubbabel  thou shalt become  a plain  and he shall bring forth the headstone  thereof with  shoutings   crying   grace  grace unto it  
8	moreover the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
9	the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house  his hands shall also finish it  and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you  
10	for who hath despised the day of small things  for they shall rejoice  and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel  with  those seven  they  are  the eyes of the lord  which run to and fro through the whole earth  
11 	then answered i  and said unto him  what  are  these two olive trees upon the right  side  of the candlestick and upon the left  side  thereof  
12	and i answered again  and said unto him  what  be these  two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden  oil  out of themselves  
13	and he answered me and said  knowest thou not what these  be   and i said  no  my lord  
14	then said he  these  are  the two anointed ones  that stand by the lord of the whole earth  
zechariah 5
1 	then i turned  and lifted up mine eyes  and looked  and behold a flying roll  
2	and he said unto me  what seest thou  and i answered  i see a flying roll  the length thereof  is  twenty cubits  and the breadth thereof ten cubits  
3	then said he unto me  this  is  the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth  for every one that stealeth shall be cut off  as  on this side according to it  and every one that sweareth shall be cut off  as  on that side according to it  
4	i will bring it forth  saith the lord of hosts  and it shall enter into the house of the thief  and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name  and it shall remain in the midst of his house  and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof  
5 	then the angel that talked with me went forth  and said unto me  lift up now thine eyes  and see what  is  this that goeth forth  
6	and i said  what  is  it  and he said  this  is  an ephah that goeth forth  he said moreover  this  is  their resemblance through all the earth  
7	and  behold  there was lifted up a talent of lead  and this  is  a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah  
8	and he said  this  is  wickedness  and he cast it into the midst of the ephah  and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof  
9	then lifted i up mine eyes  and looked  and  behold  there came out two women  and the wind  was  in their wings  for they had wings like the wings of a stork  and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven  
10	then said i to the angel that talked with me  whither do these bear the ephah  
11	and he said unto me  to build it an house in the land of shinar  and it shall be established  and set there upon her own base  
zechariah 6
1 	and i turned  and lifted up mine eyes  and looked  and  behold  there came four chariots out from between two mountains  and the mountains  were  mountains of brass  
2	in the first chariot  were  red horses  and in the second chariot black horses  
3	and in the third chariot white horses  and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses  
4	then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me  what  are  these  my lord  
5	and the angel answered and said unto me  these  are  the four spirits of the heavens  which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth  
6	the black horses which  are  therein go forth into the north country  and the white go forth after them  and the grisled go forth toward the south country  
7	and the bay went forth  and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth  and he said  get you hence  walk to and fro through the earth  so they walked to and fro through the earth  
8	then cried he upon me  and spake unto me  saying  behold  these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country  
9 	and the word of the lord came unto me  saying  
10	take of  them of  the captivity   even  of heldai  of tobijah  and of jedaiah  which are come from babylon  and come thou the same day  and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah  
11	then take silver and gold  and make crowns  and set  them  upon the head of joshua the son of josedech  the high priest  
12	and speak unto him  saying  thus speaketh the lord of hosts  saying  behold the man whose name  is  the branch  and he shall grow up out of his place  and he shall build the temple of the lord  
13	even he shall build the temple of the lord  and he shall bear the glory  and shall sit and rule upon his throne  and he shall be a priest upon his throne  and the counsel of peace shall be between them both  
14	and the crowns shall be to helem  and to tobijah  and to jedaiah  and to hen the son of zephaniah  for a memorial in the temple of the lord  
15	and they  that are  far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord  and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you  and  this  shall come to pass  if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god  
zechariah 7
1 	and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius   that  the word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth  day  of the ninth month   even  in chisleu  
2	when they had sent unto the house of god sherezer and regemmelech  and their men  to pray before the lord  
3	 and  to speak unto the priests which  were  in the house of the lord of hosts  and to the prophets  saying  should i weep in the fifth month  separating myself  as i have done these so many years  
4	then came the word of the lord of hosts unto me  saying  
5	speak unto all the people of the land  and to the priests  saying  when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh  month   even those seventy years  did ye at all fast unto me   even  to me  
6	and when ye did eat  and when ye did drink  did not ye eat  for yourselves   and drink  for yourselves   
7	 should ye  not  hear  the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets  when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity  and the cities thereof round about her  when  men  inhabited the south and the plain  
8 	and the word of the lord came unto zechariah  saying  
9	thus speaketh the lord of hosts  saying  execute true judgment  and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother  
10	and oppress not the widow  nor the fatherless  the stranger  nor the poor  and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart  
11	but they refused to hearken  and pulled away the shoulder  and stopped their ears  that they should not hear  
12	yea  they made their hearts  as  an adamant stone  lest they should hear the law  and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets  therefore came a great wrath from the lord of hosts  
13	therefore it is come to pass   that  as he cried  and they would not hear  so they cried  and i would not hear  saith the lord of hosts  
14	but i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not  thus the land was desolate after them  that no man passed through nor returned  for they laid the pleasant land desolate  
zechariah 8
1 	again the word of the lord of hosts came  to me   saying  
2	thus saith the lord of hosts  i was jealous for zion with great jealousy  and i was jealous for her with great fury  
3	thus saith the lord  i am returned unto zion  and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem  and jerusalem shall be called a city of truth  and the mountain of the lord of hosts the holy mountain  
4	thus saith the lord of hosts  there shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of jerusalem  and every man with his staff in his hand for very age  
5	and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof  
6	thus saith the lord of hosts  if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days  should it also be marvellous in mine eyes  saith the lord of hosts  
7	thus saith the lord of hosts  behold  i will save my people from the east country  and from the west country  
8	and i will bring them  and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem  and they shall be my people  and i will be their god  in truth and in righteousness  
9 	thus saith the lord of hosts  let your hands be strong  ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets  which  were  in the day  that  the foundation of the house of the lord of hosts was laid  that the temple might be built  
10	for before these days there was no hire for man  nor any hire for beast  neither  was there any  peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction  for i set all men every one against his neighbour  
11	but now i  will  not  be  unto the residue of this people as in the former days  saith the lord of hosts  
12	for the seed  shall be  prosperous  the vine shall give her fruit  and the ground shall give her increase  and the heavens shall give their dew  and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these  things   
13	and it shall come to pass   that  as ye were a curse among the heathen  o house of judah  and house of israel  so will i save you  and ye shall be a blessing  fear not   but  let your hands be strong  
14	for thus saith the lord of hosts  as i thought to punish you  when your fathers provoked me to wrath  saith the lord of hosts  and i repented not  
15	so again have i thought in these days to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah  fear ye not  
16	these  are  the things that ye shall do  speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour  execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates  
17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour  and love no false oath  for all these  are things  that i hate  saith the lord  
18 	and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me  saying  
19	thus saith the lord of hosts  the fast of the fourth  month   and the fast of the fifth  and the fast of the seventh  and the fast of the tenth  shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness  and cheerful feasts  therefore love the truth and peace  
20	thus saith the lord of hosts   it shall  yet  come to pass   that there shall come people  and the inhabitants of many cities  
21	and the inhabitants of one  city  shall go to another  saying  let us go speedily to pray before the lord  and to seek the lord of hosts  i will go also  
22	yea  many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem  and to pray before the lord  
23	thus saith the lord of hosts  in those days  it shall come to pass   that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations  even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew  saying  we will go with you  for we have heard  that  god  is  with you  
zechariah 9
1 	the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach  and damascus  shall be  the rest thereof  when the eyes of man  as of all the tribes of israel   shall be  toward the lord  
2	and hamath also shall border thereby  tyrus  and zidon  though it be very wise  
3	and tyrus did build herself a strong hold  and heaped up silver as the dust  and fine gold as the mire of the streets  
4	behold  the lord will cast her out  and he will smite her power in the sea  and she shall be devoured with fire  
5	ashkelon shall see  it   and fear  gaza also  shall see it   and be very sorrowful  and ekron  for her expectation shall be ashamed  and the king shall perish from gaza  and ashkelon shall not be inhabited  
6	and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod  and i will cut off the pride of the philistines  
7	and i will take away his blood out of his mouth  and his abominations from between his teeth  but he that remaineth  even he   shall be  for our god  and he shall be as a governor in judah  and ekron as a jebusite  
8	and i will encamp about mine house because of the army  because of him that passeth by  and because of him that returneth  and no oppressor shall pass through them any more  for now have i seen with mine eyes  
9 	rejoice greatly  o daughter of zion  shout  o daughter of jerusalem  behold  thy king cometh unto thee  he  is  just  and having salvation  lowly  and riding upon an ass  and upon a colt the foal of an ass  
10	and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim  and the horse from jerusalem  and the battle bow shall be cut off  and he shall speak peace unto the heathen  and his dominion  shall be  from sea  even  to sea  and from the river  even  to the ends of the earth  
11	as for thee also  by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein  is  no water  
12 	turn you to the strong hold  ye prisoners of hope  even to day do i declare  that  i will render double unto thee  
13	when i have bent judah for me  filled the bow with ephraim  and raised up thy sons  o zion  against thy sons  o greece  and made thee as the sword of a mighty man  
14	and the lord shall be seen over them  and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning  and the lord god shall blow the trumpet  and shall go with whirlwinds of the south  
15	the lord of hosts shall defend them  and they shall devour  and subdue with sling stones  and they shall drink   and  make a noise as through wine  and they shall be filled like bowls   and  as the corners of the altar  
16	and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock of his people  for they  shall be as  the stones of a crown  lifted up as an ensign upon his land  
17	for how great  is  his goodness  and how great  is  his beauty  corn shall make the young men cheerful  and new wine the maids  
zechariah 10
1 	ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain   so  the lord shall make bright clouds  and give them showers of rain  to every one grass in the field  
2	for the idols have spoken vanity  and the diviners have seen a lie  and have told false dreams  they comfort in vain  therefore they went their way as a flock  they were troubled  because  there was  no shepherd  
3	mine anger was kindled against the shepherds  and i punished the goats  for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah  and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle  
4	out of him came forth the corner  out of him the nail  out of him the battle bow  out of him every oppressor together  
5 	and they shall be as mighty  men   which tread down  their enemies  in the mire of the streets in the battle  and they shall fight  because the lord  is  with them  and the riders on horses shall be confounded  
6	and i will strengthen the house of judah  and i will save the house of joseph  and i will bring them again to place them  for i have mercy upon them  and they shall be as though i had not cast them off  for i  am  the lord their god  and will hear them  
7	and  they of  ephraim shall be like a mighty  man   and their heart shall rejoice as through wine  yea  their children shall see  it   and be glad  their heart shall rejoice in the lord  
8	i will hiss for them  and gather them  for i have redeemed them  and they shall increase as they have increased  
9	and i will sow them among the people  and they shall remember me in far countries  and they shall live with their children  and turn again  
10	i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt  and gather them out of assyria  and i will bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon  and  place  shall not be found for them  
11	and he shall pass through the sea with affliction  and shall smite the waves in the sea  and all the deeps of the river shall dry up  and the pride of assyria shall be brought down  and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away  
12	and i will strengthen them in the lord  and they shall walk up and down in his name  saith the lord  
zechariah 11
1 	open thy doors  o lebanon  that the fire may devour thy cedars  
2	howl  fir tree  for the cedar is fallen  because the mighty are spoiled  howl  o ye oaks of bashan  for the forest of the vintage is come down  
3	 there is  a voice of the howling of the shepherds  for their glory is spoiled  a voice of the roaring of young lions  for the pride of jordan is spoiled  
4 	thus saith the lord my god  feed the flock of the slaughter  
5	whose possessors slay them  and hold themselves not guilty  and they that sell them say  blessed  be  the lord  for i am rich  and their own shepherds pity them not  
6	for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land  saith the lord  but  lo  i will deliver the men every one into his neighbour s hand  and into the hand of his king  and they shall smite the land  and out of their hand i will not deliver  them   
7	and i will feed the flock of slaughter   even  you  o poor of the flock  and i took unto me two staves  the one i called beauty  and the other i called bands  and i fed the flock  
8	three shepherds also i cut off in one month  and my soul lothed them  and their soul also abhorred me  
9	then said i  i will not feed you  that that dieth  let it die  and that that is to be cut off  let it be cut off  and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another  
10	and i took my staff   even  beauty  and cut it asunder  that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people  
11	and it was broken in that day  and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it  was  the word of the lord  
12	and i said unto them  if ye think good  give  me  my price  and if not  forbear  so they weighed for my price thirty  pieces  of silver  
13	and the lord said unto me  cast it unto the potter  a goodly price that i was prised at of them  and i took the thirty  pieces  of silver  and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord  
14	then i cut asunder mine other staff   even  bands  that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel  
15 	and the lord said unto me  take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd  
16	for  lo  i will raise up a shepherd in the land   which  shall not visit those that be cut off  neither shall seek the young one  nor heal that that is broken  nor feed that that standeth still  but he shall eat the flesh of the fat  and tear their claws in pieces  
17	woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock  the sword  shall be  upon his arm  and upon his right eye  his arm shall be clean dried up  and his right eye shall be utterly darkened

1 	the burden of the word of the lord for israel  saith the lord  which stretcheth forth the heavens  and layeth the foundation of the earth  and formeth the spirit of man within him  
2	behold  i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about  when they shall be in the siege both against judah  and  against jerusalem  
3	and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people  all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces  though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it  
4	in that day  saith the lord  i will smite every horse with astonishment  and his rider with madness  and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah  and will smite every horse of the people with blindness  
5	and the governors of judah shall say in their heart  the inhabitants of jerusalem  shall be  my strength in the lord of hosts their god  
6	in that day will i make the governors of judah like an hearth of fire among the wood  and like a torch of fire in a sheaf  and they shall devour all the people round about  on the right hand and on the left  and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place   even  in jerusalem  
7	the lord also shall save the tents of judah first  that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify  themselves  against judah  
8	in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem  and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david  and the house of david  shall be  as god  as the angel of the lord before them  
9 	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem  
10	and i will pour upon the house of david  and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem  the spirit of grace and of supplications  and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced  and they shall mourn for him  as one mourneth for  his  only  son   and shall be in bitterness for him  as one that is in bitterness for  his  firstborn  
11	in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem  as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon  
12	and the land shall mourn  every family apart  the family of the house of david apart  and their wives apart  the family of the house of nathan apart  and their wives apart  
13	the family of the house of levi apart  and their wives apart  the family of shimei apart  and their wives apart  
14	all the families that remain  every family apart  and their wives apart  
zechariah 13
1 	in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness  
2	and it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord of hosts   that  i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land  and they shall no more be remembered  and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land  
3	and it shall come to pass   that  when any shall yet prophesy  then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him  thou shalt not live  for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord  and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth  
4	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision  when he hath prophesied  neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive  
5	but he shall say  i  am  no prophet  i  am  an husbandman  for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth  
6	and  one  shall say unto him  what  are  these wounds in thine hands  then he shall answer   those  with which i was wounded  in  the house of my friends  
7 	awake  o sword  against my shepherd  and against the man  that is  my fellow  saith the lord of hosts  smite the shepherd  and the sheep shall be scattered  and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones  
8	and it shall come to pass   that  in all the land  saith the lord  two parts therein shall be cut off  and  die  but the third shall be left therein  
9	and i will bring the third part through the fire  and will refine them as silver is refined  and will try them as gold is tried  they shall call on my name  and i will hear them  i will say  it  is  my people  and they shall say  the lord  is  my god  
zechariah 14
1 	behold  the day of the lord cometh  and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee  
2	for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle  and the city shall be taken  and the houses rifled  and the women ravished  and half of the city shall go forth into captivity  and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city  
3	then shall the lord go forth  and fight against those nations  as when he fought in the day of battle  
4	and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives  which  is  before jerusalem on the east  and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west   and there shall be  a very great valley  and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north  and half of it toward the south  
5	and ye shall flee  to  the valley of the mountains  for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azal  yea  ye shall flee  like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah  and the lord my god shall come   and  all the saints with thee  
6	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  the light shall not be clear   nor  dark  
7	but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord  not day  nor night  but it shall come to pass   that  at evening time it shall be light  
8 	and it shall be in that day   that  living waters shall go out from jerusalem  half of them toward the former sea  and half of them toward the hinder sea  in summer and in winter shall it be  
9	and the lord shall be king over all the earth  in that day shall there be one lord  and his name one  
10	all the land shall be turned as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem  and it shall be lifted up  and inhabited in her place  from benjamin s gate unto the place of the first gate  unto the corner gate  and  from  the tower of hananeel unto the king s winepresses  
11	and  men  shall dwell in it  and there shall be no more utter destruction  but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited  
12	and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem  their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet  and their eyes shall consume away in their holes  and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth  
13	and it shall come to pass in that day   that  a great tumult from the lord shall be among them  and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour  and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour  
14	and judah also shall fight at jerusalem  and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together  gold  and silver  and apparel  in great abundance  
15	and so shall be the plague of the horse  of the mule  of the camel  and of the ass  and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents  as this plague  
16 	and it shall come to pass   that  every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king  the lord of hosts  and to keep the feast of tabernacles  
17	and it shall be   that  whoso will not come up of  all  the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king  the lord of hosts  even upon them shall be no rain  
18	and if the family of egypt go not up  and come not  that  have  no  rain   there shall be the plague  wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles  
19	this shall be the punishment of egypt  and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles  
20	in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses  holiness unto the lord  and the pots in the lord s house shall be like the bowls before the altar  
21	yea  every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of hosts  and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them  and seethe therein  and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts  

malachi
malachi 1
1 	the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi  
2	i have loved you  saith the lord  yet ye say  wherein hast thou loved us   was  not esau jacob s brother  saith the lord  yet i loved jacob  
3	and i hated esau  and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness  
4	whereas edom saith  we are impoverished  but we will return and build the desolate places  thus saith the lord of hosts  they shall build  but i will throw down  and they shall call them  the border of wickedness  and  the people against whom the lord hath indignation for ever  
5	and your eyes shall see  and ye shall say  the lord will be magnified from the border of israel  
6 	a son honoureth  his  father  and a servant his master  if then i  be  a father  where  is  mine honour  and if i  be  a master  where  is  my fear  saith the lord of hosts unto you  o priests  that despise my name  and ye say  wherein have we despised thy name  
7	ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar  and ye say  wherein have we polluted thee  in that ye say  the table of the lord  is  contemptible  
8	and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice   is it  not evil  and if ye offer the lame and sick   is it  not evil  offer it now unto thy governor  will he be pleased with thee  or accept thy person  saith the lord of hosts  
9	and now  i pray you  beseech god that he will be gracious unto us  this hath been by your means  will he regard your persons  saith the lord of hosts  
10	who  is there  even among you that would shut the doors  for nought   neither do ye kindle  fire  on mine altar for nought  i have no pleasure in you  saith the lord of hosts  neither will i accept an offering at your hand  
11	for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name  shall be  great among the gentiles  and in every place incense  shall be  offered unto my name  and a pure offering  for my name  shall be  great among the heathen  saith the lord of hosts  
12	but ye have profaned it  in that ye say  the table of the lord  is  polluted  and the fruit thereof   even  his meat   is  contemptible  
13	ye said also  behold  what a weariness  is it   and ye have snuffed at it  saith the lord of hosts  and ye brought  that which was  torn  and the lame  and the sick  thus ye brought an offering  should i accept this of your hand  saith the lord  
14	but cursed  be  the deceiver  which hath in his flock a male  and voweth  and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing  for i  am  a great king  saith the lord of hosts  and my name  is  dreadful among the heathen  
malachi 2
1 	and now  o ye priests  this commandment  is  for you  
2	if ye will not hear  and if ye will not lay  it  to heart  to give glory unto my name  saith the lord of hosts  i will even send a curse upon you  and i will curse your blessings  yea  i have cursed them already  because ye do not lay  it  to heart  
3	behold  i will corrupt your seed  and spread dung upon your faces   even  the dung of your solemn feasts  and  one  shall take you away with it  
4	and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you  that my covenant might be with levi  saith the lord of hosts  
5	my covenant was with him of life and peace  and i gave them to him  for  the fear wherewith he feared me  and was afraid before my name  
6	the law of truth was in his mouth  and iniquity was not found in his lips  he walked with me in peace and equity  and did turn many away from iniquity  
7	for the priest s lips should keep knowledge  and they should seek the law at his mouth  for he  is  the messenger of the lord of hosts  
8	but ye are departed out of the way  ye have caused many to stumble at the law  ye have corrupted the covenant of levi  saith the lord of hosts  
9	therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people  according as ye have not kept my ways  but have been partial in the law  
10 	have we not all one father  hath not one god created us  why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother  by profaning the covenant of our fathers  
11	judah hath dealt treacherously  and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem  for judah hath profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved  and hath married the daughter of a strange god  
12	the lord will cut off the man that doeth this  the master and the scholar  out of the tabernacles of jacob  and him that offereth an offering unto the lord of hosts  
13	and this have ye done again  covering the altar of the lord with tears  with weeping  and with crying out  insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more  or receiveth  it  with good will at your hand  
14	yet ye say  wherefore  because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth  against whom thou hast dealt treacherously  yet  is  she thy companion  and the wife of thy covenant  
15	and did not he make one  yet had he the residue of the spirit  and wherefore one  that he might seek a godly seed  therefore take heed to your spirit  and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth  
16	for the lord  the god of israel  saith that he hateth putting away  for  one  covereth violence with his garment  saith the lord of hosts  therefore take heed to your spirit  that ye deal not treacherously  
17	ye have wearied the lord with your words  yet ye say  wherein have we wearied  him   when ye say  every one that doeth evil  is  good in the sight of the lord  and he delighteth in them  or  where  is  the god of judgment  
malachi 3
1 	behold  i will send my messenger  and he shall prepare the way before me  and the lord  whom ye seek  shall suddenly come to his temple  even the messenger of the covenant  whom ye delight in  behold  he shall come  saith the lord of hosts  
2	but who may abide the day of his coming  and who shall stand when he appeareth  for he  is  like a refiner s fire  and like fullers  soap  
3	and he shall sit  as  a refiner and purifier of silver  and he shall purify the sons of levi  and purge them as gold and silver  that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness  
4	then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord  as in the days of old  and as in former years  
5	and i will come near to you to judgment  and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers  and against the adulterers  and against false swearers  and against those that oppress the hireling in  his  wages  the widow  and the fatherless  and that turn aside the stranger  from his right   and fear not me  saith the lord of hosts  
6	for i  am  the lord  i change not  therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed  
7 	even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances  and have not kept  them   return unto me  and i will return unto you  saith the lord of hosts  but ye said  wherein shall we return  
8	will a man rob god  yet ye have robbed me  but ye say  wherein have we robbed thee  in tithes and offerings  
9	ye  are  cursed with a curse  for ye have robbed me   even  this whole nation  
10	bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse  that there may be meat in mine house  and prove me now herewith  saith the lord of hosts  if i will not open you the windows of heaven  and pour you out a blessing  that  there shall  not  be room  enough  to receive it   
11	and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes  and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground  neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field  saith the lord of hosts  
12	and all nations shall call you blessed  for ye shall be a delightsome land  saith the lord of hosts  
13 	your words have been stout against me  saith the lord  yet ye say  what have we spoken  so much  against thee  
14	ye have said  it  is  vain to serve god  and what profit  is it  that we have kept his ordinance  and that we have walked mournfully before the lord of hosts  
15	and now we call the proud happy  yea  they that work wickedness are set up  yea   they that  tempt god are even delivered  
16	then they that feared the lord spake often one to another  and the lord hearkened  and heard  it   and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord  and that thought upon his name  
17	and they shall be mine  saith the lord of hosts  in that day when i make up my jewels  and i will spare them  as a man spareth his own son that serveth him  
18	then shall ye return  and discern between the righteous and the wicked  between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not  
malachi 4
1 	for  behold  the day cometh  that shall burn as an oven  and all the proud  yea  and all that do wickedly  shall be stubble  and the day that cometh shall burn them up  saith the lord of hosts  that it shall leave them neither root nor branch  
2	but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings  and ye shall go forth  and grow up as calves of the stall  
3	and ye shall tread down the wicked  for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do  this   saith the lord of hosts  
4 	remember ye the law of moses my servant  which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel   with  the statutes and judgments  
5	behold  i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord  
6	and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children  and the heart of the children to their fathers  lest i come and smite the earth with a curse

matthew 1
1 	the book of the generation of jesus christ  the son of david  the son of abraham  
2	abraham begat isaac  and isaac begat jacob  and jacob begat judas and his brethren  
3	and judas begat phares and zara of thamar  and phares begat esrom  and esrom begat aram  
4	and aram begat aminadab  and aminadab begat naasson  and naasson begat salmon  
5	and salmon begat booz of rachab  and booz begat obed of ruth  and obed begat jesse  
6	and jesse begat david the king  and david the king begat solomon of her  that had been the wife  of urias  
7	and solomon begat roboam  and roboam begat abia  and abia begat asa  
8	and asa begat josaphat  and josaphat begat joram  and joram begat ozias  
9	and ozias begat joatham  and joatham begat achaz  and achaz begat ezekias  
10	and ezekias begat manasses  and manasses begat amon  and amon begat josias  
11	and josias begat jechonias and his brethren  about the time they were carried away to babylon  
12	and after they were brought to babylon  jechonias begat salathiel  and salathiel begat zorobabel  
13	and zorobabel begat abiud  and abiud begat eliakim  and eliakim begat azor  
14	and azor begat sadoc  and sadoc begat achim  and achim begat eliud  
15	and eliud begat eleazar  and eleazar begat matthan  and matthan begat jacob  
16	and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary  of whom was born jesus  who is called christ  
17	so all the generations from abraham to david  are  fourteen generations  and from david until the carrying away into babylon  are  fourteen generations  and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ  are  fourteen generations  
18 	now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise  when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph  before they came together  she was found with child of the holy ghost  
19	then joseph her husband  being a just  man   and not willing to make her a publick example  was minded to put her away privily  
20	but while he thought on these things  behold  the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream  saying  joseph  thou son of david  fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife  for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost  
21	and she shall bring forth a son  and thou shalt call his name jesus  for he shall save his people from their sins  
22	now all this was done  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet  saying  
23	behold  a virgin shall be with child  and shall bring forth a son  and they shall call his name emmanuel  which being interpreted is  god with us  
24	then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him  and took unto him his wife  
25	and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son  and he called his name jesus  
matthew 2
1 	now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king  behold  there came wise men from the east to jerusalem  
2	saying  where is he that is born king of the jews  for we have seen his star in the east  and are come to worship him  
3	when herod the king had heard  these things   he was troubled  and all jerusalem with him  
4	and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together  he demanded of them where christ should be born  
5	and they said unto him  in bethlehem of judaea  for thus it is written by the prophet  
6	and thou bethlehem   in  the land of juda  art not the least among the princes of juda  for out of thee shall come a governor  that shall rule my people israel  
7	then herod  when he had privily called the wise men  enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared  
8	and he sent them to bethlehem  and said  go and search diligently for the young child  and when ye have found  him   bring me word again  that i may come and worship him also  
9 	when they had heard the king  they departed  and  lo  the star  which they saw in the east  went before them  till it came and stood over where the young child was  
10	when they saw the star  they rejoiced with exceeding great joy  
11	and when they were come into the house  they saw the young child with mary his mother  and fell down  and worshipped him  and when they had opened their treasures  they presented unto him gifts  gold  and frankincense  and myrrh  
12	and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod  they departed into their own country another way  
13 	and when they were departed  behold  the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream  saying  arise  and take the young child and his mother  and flee into egypt  and be thou there until i bring thee word  for herod will seek the young child to destroy him  
14	when he arose  he took the young child and his mother by night  and departed into egypt  
15	and was there until the death of herod  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet  saying  out of egypt have i called my son  
16 	then herod  when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men  was exceeding wroth  and sent forth  and slew all the children that were in bethlehem  and in all the coasts thereof  from two years old and under  according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men  
17	then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet  saying  
18	in rama was there a voice heard  lamentation  and weeping  and great mourning  rachel weeping  for  her children  and would not be comforted  because they are not  
19 	but when herod was dead  behold  an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt  
20	saying  arise  and take the young child and his mother  and go into the land of israel  for they are dead which sought the young child s life  
21	and he arose  and took the young child and his mother  and came into the land of israel  
22	but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod  he was afraid to go thither  notwithstanding  being warned of god in a dream  he turned aside into the parts of galilee  
23	and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets  he shall be called a nazarene  
matthew 3
1 	in those days came john the baptist  preaching in the wilderness of judaea  
2	and saying  repent ye  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand  
3	for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias  saying  the voice of one crying in the wilderness  prepare ye the way of the lord  make his paths straight  
4	and the same john had his raiment of camel s hair  and a leathern girdle about his loins  and his meat was locusts and wild honey  
5	then went out to him jerusalem  and all judaea  and all the region round about jordan  
6	and were baptized of him in jordan  confessing their sins  
7 	but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism  he said unto them  o generation of vipers  who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come  
8	bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance  
9	and think not to say within yourselves  we have abraham to  our  father  for i say unto you  that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham  
10	and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees  therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire  
11	i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance  but he that cometh after me is mightier than i  whose shoes i am not worthy to bear  he shall baptize you with the holy ghost  and  with  fire  
12	whose fan  is  in his hand  and he will throughly purge his floor  and gather his wheat into the garner  but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire  
13 	then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john  to be baptized of him  
14	but john forbad him  saying  i have need to be baptized of thee  and comest thou to me  
15	and jesus answering said unto him  suffer  it to be so  now  for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness  then he suffered him  
16	and jesus  when he was baptized  went up straightway out of the water  and  lo  the heavens were opened unto him  and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove  and lighting upon him  
17	and lo a voice from heaven  saying  this is my beloved son  in whom i am well pleased  
matthew 4
1 	then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil  
2	and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights  he was afterward an hungred  
3	and when the tempter came to him  he said  if thou be the son of god  command that these stones be made bread  
4	but he answered and said  it is written  man shall not live by bread alone  but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god  
5	then the devil taketh him up into the holy city  and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple  
6	and saith unto him  if thou be the son of god  cast thyself down  for it is written  he shall give his angels charge concerning thee  and in  their  hands they shall bear thee up  lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone  
7	jesus said unto him  it is written again  thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god  
8	again  the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain  and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world  and the glory of them  
9	and saith unto him  all these things will i give thee  if thou wilt fall down and worship me  
10	then saith jesus unto him  get thee hence  satan  for it is written  thou shalt worship the lord thy god  and him only shalt thou serve  
11	then the devil leaveth him  and  behold  angels came and ministered unto him  
12 	now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison  he departed into galilee  
13	and leaving nazareth  he came and dwelt in capernaum  which is upon the sea coast  in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim  
14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet  saying  
15	the land of zabulon  and the land of nephthalim   by  the way of the sea  beyond jordan  galilee of the gentiles  
16	the people which sat in darkness saw great light  and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up  
17	from that time jesus began to preach  and to say  repent  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand  
18 	and jesus  walking by the sea of galilee  saw two brethren  simon called peter  and andrew his brother  casting a net into the sea  for they were fishers  
19	and he saith unto them  follow me  and i will make you fishers of men  
20	and they straightway left  their  nets  and followed him  
21	and going on from thence  he saw other two brethren  james  the son  of zebedee  and john his brother  in a ship with zebedee their father  mending their nets  and he called them  
22	and they immediately left the ship and their father  and followed him  
23 	and jesus went about all galilee  teaching in their synagogues  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom  and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people  
24	and his fame went throughout all syria  and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments  and those which were possessed with devils  and those which were lunatick  and those that had the palsy  and he healed them  
25	and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee  and  from  decapolis  and  from  jerusalem  and  from  judaea  and  from  beyond jordan  
matthew 5
1 	and seeing the multitudes  he went up into a mountain  and when he was set  his disciples came unto him  
2	and he opened his mouth  and taught them  saying  
3 	blessed  are  the poor in spirit  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  
4	blessed  are  they that mourn  for they shall be comforted  
5	blessed  are  the meek  for they shall inherit the earth  
6	blessed  are  they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness  for they shall be filled  
7	blessed  are  the merciful  for they shall obtain mercy  
8	blessed  are  the pure in heart  for they shall see god  
9	blessed  are  the peacemakers  for they shall be called the children of god  
10	blessed  are  they which are persecuted for righteousness  sake  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  
11	blessed are ye  when  men  shall revile you  and persecute  you   and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely  for my sake  
12	rejoice  and be exceeding glad  for great  is  your reward in heaven  for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you  
13 	ye are the salt of the earth  but if the salt have lost his savour  wherewith shall it be salted  it is thenceforth good for nothing  but to be cast out  and to be trodden under foot of men  
14	ye are the light of the world  a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid  
15	neither do men light a candle  and put it under a bushel  but on a candlestick  and it giveth light unto all that are in the house  
16	let your light so shine before men  that they may see your good works  and glorify your father which is in heaven  
17 	think not that i am come to destroy the law  or the prophets  i am not come to destroy  but to fulfil  
18	for verily i say unto you  till heaven and earth pass  one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law  till all be fulfilled  
19	whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments  and shall teach men so  he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven  but whosoever shall do and teach  them   the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven  
20	for i say unto you  that except your righteousness shall exceed  the righteousness  of the scribes and pharisees  ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven  
21 	ye have heard that it was said by them of old time  thou shalt not kill  and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment  
22	but i say unto you  that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment  and whosoever shall say to his brother  raca  shall be in danger of the council  but whosoever shall say  thou fool  shall be in danger of hell fire  
23	therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar  and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee  
24	leave there thy gift before the altar  and go thy way  first be reconciled to thy brother  and then come and offer thy gift  
25	agree with thine adversary quickly  whiles thou art in the way with him  lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge  and the judge deliver thee to the officer  and thou be cast into prison  
26	verily i say unto thee  thou shalt by no means come out thence  till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing  
27 	ye have heard that it was said by them of old time  thou shalt not commit adultery  
28	but i say unto you  that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart  
29	and if thy right eye offend thee  pluck it out  and cast  it  from thee  for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish  and not  that  thy whole body should be cast into hell  
30	and if thy right hand offend thee  cut it off  and cast  it  from thee  for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish  and not  that  thy whole body should be cast into hell  
31	it hath been said  whosoever shall put away his wife  let him give her a writing of divorcement  
32	but i say unto you  that whosoever shall put away his wife  saving for the cause of fornication  causeth her to commit adultery  and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery  
33 	again  ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time  thou shalt not forswear thyself  but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths  
34	but i say unto you  swear not at all  neither by heaven  for it is god s throne  
35	nor by the earth  for it is his footstool  neither by jerusalem  for it is the city of the great king  
36	neither shalt thou swear by thy head  because thou canst not make one hair white or black  
37	but let your communication be  yea  yea  nay  nay  for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil  
38 	ye have heard that it hath been said  an eye for an eye  and a tooth for a tooth  
39	but i say unto you  that ye resist not evil  but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek  turn to him the other also  
40	and if any man will sue thee at the law  and take away thy coat  let him have  thy  cloke also  
41	and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile  go with him twain  
42	give to him that asketh thee  and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away  
43 	ye have heard that it hath been said  thou shalt love thy neighbour  and hate thine enemy  
44	but i say unto you  love your enemies  bless them that curse you  do good to them that hate you  and pray for them which despitefully use you  and persecute you  
45	that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven  for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good  and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust  
46	for if ye love them which love you  what reward have ye  do not even the publicans the same  
47	and if ye salute your brethren only  what do ye more  than others   do not even the publicans so  
48	be ye therefore perfect  even as your father which is in heaven is perfect  
matthew 6
1 	take heed that ye do not your alms before men  to be seen of them  otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven  
2	therefore when thou doest  thine  alms  do not sound a trumpet before thee  as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets  that they may have glory of men  verily i say unto you  they have their reward  
3	but when thou doest alms  let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth  
4	that thine alms may be in secret  and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly  
5 	and when thou prayest  thou shalt not be as the hypocrites  are   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets  that they may be seen of men  verily i say unto you  they have their reward  
6	but thou  when thou prayest  enter into thy closet  and when thou hast shut thy door  pray to thy father which is in secret  and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly  
7	but when ye pray  use not vain repetitions  as the heathen  do   for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking  
8	be not ye therefore like unto them  for your father knoweth what things ye have need of  before ye ask him  
9 	after this manner therefore pray ye  our father which art in heaven  hallowed be thy name  
10	thy kingdom come  thy will be done in earth  as  it is  in heaven  
11	give us this day our daily bread  
12	and forgive us our debts  as we forgive our debtors  
13	and lead us not into temptation  but deliver us from evil  for thine is the kingdom  and the power  and the glory  for ever  amen  
14	for if ye forgive men their trespasses  your heavenly father will also forgive you  
15	but if ye forgive not men their trespasses  neither will your father forgive your trespasses  
16 	moreover when ye fast  be not  as the hypocrites  of a sad countenance  for they disfigure their faces  that they may appear unto men to fast  verily i say unto you  they have their reward  
17	but thou  when thou fastest  anoint thine head  and wash thy face  
18	that thou appear not unto men to fast  but unto thy father which is in secret  and thy father  which seeth in secret  shall reward thee openly  
19 	lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth  where moth and rust doth corrupt  and where thieves break through and steal  
20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven  where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt  and where thieves do not break through nor steal  
21	for where your treasure is  there will your heart be also  
22	the light of the body is the eye  if therefore thine eye be single  thy whole body shall be full of light  
23	but if thine eye be evil  thy whole body shall be full of darkness  if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness  how great  is  that darkness  
24	no man can serve two masters  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or else he will hold to the one  and despise the other  ye cannot serve god and mammon  
25 	therefore i say unto you  take no thought for your life  what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink  nor yet for your body  what ye shall put on  is not the life more than meat  and the body than raiment  
26	behold the fowls of the air  for they sow not  neither do they reap  nor gather into barns  yet your heavenly father feedeth them  are ye not much better than they  
27	which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature  
28	and why take ye thought for raiment  consider the lilies of the field  how they grow  they toil not  neither do they spin  
29	and yet i say unto you  that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these  
30	wherefore  if god so clothe the grass of the field  which to day is  and to morrow is cast into the oven   shall he  not much more  clothe  you  o ye of little faith  
31	therefore take no thought  saying  what shall we eat  or  what shall we drink  or  wherewithal shall we be clothed  
32	 for after all these things do the gentiles seek   for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things  
33	but seek ye first the kingdom of god  and his righteousness  and all these things shall be added unto you  
34	take therefore no thought for the morrow  for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself  sufficient unto the day  is  the evil thereof  
matthew 7
1 	judge not  that ye be not judged  
2	for with what judgment ye judge  ye shall be judged  and with what measure ye mete  it shall be measured to you again  
3	and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye  but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye  
4	or how wilt thou say to thy brother  let me pull out the mote out of thine eye  and  behold  a beam  is  in thine own eye  
5	thou hypocrite  first cast out the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye  
6	give not that which is holy unto the dogs  neither cast ye your pearls before swine  lest they trample them under their feet  and turn again and rend you  
7 	ask  and it shall be given you  seek  and ye shall find  knock  and it shall be opened unto you  
8	for every one that asketh receiveth  and he that seeketh findeth  and to him that knocketh it shall be opened  
9	or what man is there of you  whom if his son ask bread  will he give him a stone  
10	or if he ask a fish  will he give him a serpent  
11	if ye then  being evil  know how to give good gifts unto your children  how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him  
12 	therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you  do ye even so to them  for this is the law and the prophets  
13	enter ye in at the strait gate  for wide  is  the gate  and broad  is  the way  that leadeth to destruction  and many there be which go in thereat  
14	because strait  is  the gate  and narrow  is  the way  which leadeth unto life  and few there be that find it  
15 	beware of false prophets  which come to you in sheep s clothing  but inwardly they are ravening wolves  
16	ye shall know them by their fruits  do men gather grapes of thorns  or figs of thistles  
17	even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit  but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit  
18	a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit  neither  can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit  
19	every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire  
20	wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them  
21 	not every one that saith unto me  lord  lord  shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven  
22	many will say to me in that day  lord  lord  have we not prophesied in thy name  and in thy name have cast out devils  and in thy name done many wonderful works  
23	and then will i profess unto them  i never knew you  depart from me  ye that work iniquity  
24	therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine  and doeth them  i will liken him unto a wise man  which built his house upon a rock  
25	and the rain descended  and the floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon that house  and it fell not  for it was founded upon a rock  
26	and every one that heareth these sayings of mine  and doeth them not  shall be likened unto a foolish man  which built his house upon the sand  
27	and the rain descended  and the floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon that house  and it fell  and great was the fall of it  
28	and it came to pass  when jesus had ended these sayings  the people were astonished at his doctrine  
29	for he taught them as  one  having authority  and not as the scribes  
matthew 8
1 	when he was come down from the mountain  great multitudes followed him  
2	and  behold  there came a leper and worshipped him  saying  lord  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  
3	and jesus put forth  his  hand  and touched him  saying  i will  be thou clean  and immediately his leprosy was cleansed  
4	and jesus saith unto him  see thou tell no man  but go thy way  shew thyself to the priest  and offer the gift that moses commanded  for a testimony unto them  
5 	and when jesus was entered into capernaum  there came unto him a centurion  beseeching him  
6	and saying  lord  my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy  grievously tormented  
7	and jesus saith unto him  i will come and heal him  
8	the centurion answered and said  lord  i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof  but speak the word only  and my servant shall be healed  
9	for i am a man under authority  having soldiers under me  and i say to this  man   go  and he goeth  and to another  come  and he cometh  and to my servant  do this  and he doeth  it   
10	when jesus heard  it   he marvelled  and said to them that followed  verily i say unto you  i have not found so great faith  no  not in israel  
11	and i say unto you  that many shall come from the east and west  and shall sit down with abraham  and isaac  and jacob  in the kingdom of heaven  
12	but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  
13	and jesus said unto the centurion  go thy way  and as thou hast believed   so  be it done unto thee  and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour  
14 	and when jesus was come into peter s house  he saw his wife s mother laid  and sick of a fever  
15	and he touched her hand  and the fever left her  and she arose  and ministered unto them  
16	when the even was come  they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils  and he cast out the spirits with  his  word  and healed all that were sick  
17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet  saying  himself took our infirmities  and bare  our  sicknesses  
18 	now when jesus saw great multitudes about him  he gave commandment to depart unto the other side  
19	and a certain scribe came  and said unto him  master  i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest  
20	and jesus saith unto him  the foxes have holes  and the birds of the air  have  nests  but the son of man hath not where to lay  his  head  
21	and another of his disciples said unto him  lord  suffer me first to go and bury my father  
22	but jesus said unto him  follow me  and let the dead bury their dead  
23 	and when he was entered into a ship  his disciples followed him  
24	and  behold  there arose a great tempest in the sea  insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves  but he was asleep  
25	and his disciples came to  him   and awoke him  saying  lord  save us  we perish  
26	and he saith unto them  why are ye fearful  o ye of little faith  then he arose  and rebuked the winds and the sea  and there was a great calm  
27	but the men marvelled  saying  what manner of man is this  that even the winds and the sea obey him  
28 	and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes  there met him two possessed with devils  coming out of the tombs  exceeding fierce  so that no man might pass by that way  
29	and  behold  they cried out  saying  what have we to do with thee  jesus  thou son of god  art thou come hither to torment us before the time  
30	and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding  
31	so the devils besought him  saying  if thou cast us out  suffer us to go away into the herd of swine  
32	and he said unto them  go  and when they were come out  they went into the herd of swine  and  behold  the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea  and perished in the waters  
33	and they that kept them fled  and went their ways into the city  and told every thing  and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils  
34	and  behold  the whole city came out to meet jesus  and when they saw him  they besought  him  that he would depart out of their coasts  
matthew 9
1 	and he entered into a ship  and passed over  and came into his own city  
2	and  behold  they brought to him a man sick of the palsy  lying on a bed  and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy  son  be of good cheer  thy sins be forgiven thee  
3	and  behold  certain of the scribes said within themselves  this  man  blasphemeth  
4	and jesus knowing their thoughts said  wherefore think ye evil in your hearts  
5	for whether is easier  to say   thy  sins be forgiven thee  or to say  arise  and walk  
6	but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins   then saith he to the sick of the palsy   arise  take up thy bed  and go unto thine house  
7	and he arose  and departed to his house  
8	but when the multitudes saw  it   they marvelled  and glorified god  which had given such power unto men  
9 	and as jesus passed forth from thence  he saw a man  named matthew  sitting at the receipt of custom  and he saith unto him  follow me  and he arose  and followed him  
10	and it came to pass  as jesus sat at meat in the house  behold  many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples  
11	and when the pharisees saw  it   they said unto his disciples  why eateth your master with publicans and sinners  
12	but when jesus heard  that   he said unto them  they that be whole need not a physician  but they that are sick  
13	but go ye and learn what  that  meaneth  i will have mercy  and not sacrifice  for i am not come to call the righteous  but sinners to repentance  
14 	then came to him the disciples of john  saying  why do we and the pharisees fast oft  but thy disciples fast not  
15	and jesus said unto them  can the children of the bridechamber mourn  as long as the bridegroom is with them  but the days will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken from them  and then shall they fast  
16	no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment  for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment  and the rent is made worse  
17	neither do men put new wine into old bottles  else the bottles break  and the wine runneth out  and the bottles perish  but they put new wine into new bottles  and both are preserved  
18 	while he spake these things unto them  behold  there came a certain ruler  and worshipped him  saying  my daughter is even now dead  but come and lay thy hand upon her  and she shall live  
19	and jesus arose  and followed him  and  so did  his disciples  
20	and  behold  a woman  which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years  came behind  him   and touched the hem of his garment  
21	for she said within herself  if i may but touch his garment  i shall be whole  
22	but jesus turned him about  and when he saw her  he said  daughter  be of good comfort  thy faith hath made thee whole  and the woman was made whole from that hour  
23	and when jesus came into the ruler s house  and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise  
24	he said unto them  give place  for the maid is not dead  but sleepeth  and they laughed him to scorn  
25	but when the people were put forth  he went in  and took her by the hand  and the maid arose  
26	and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land  
27 	and when jesus departed thence  two blind men followed him  crying  and saying   thou  son of david  have mercy on us  
28	and when he was come into the house  the blind men came to him  and jesus saith unto them  believe ye that i am able to do this  they said unto him  yea  lord  
29	then touched he their eyes  saying  according to your faith be it unto you  
30	and their eyes were opened  and jesus straitly charged them  saying  see  that  no man know  it   
31	but they  when they were departed  spread abroad his fame in all that country  
32	as they went out  behold  they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil  
33	and when the devil was cast out  the dumb spake  and the multitudes marvelled  saying  it was never so seen in israel  
34	but the pharisees said  he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils  
35 	and jesus went about all the cities and villages  teaching in their synagogues  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom  and healing every sickness and every disease among the people  
36	but when he saw the multitudes  he was moved with compassion on them  because they fainted  and were scattered abroad  as sheep having no shepherd  
37	then saith he unto his disciples  the harvest truly  is  plenteous  but the labourers  are  few  
38	pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest  that he will send forth labourers into his harvest  
matthew 10
1 	and when he had called unto  him  his twelve disciples  he gave them power  against  unclean spirits  to cast them out  and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease  
2	now the names of the twelve apostles are these  the first  simon  who is called peter  and andrew his brother  james  the son  of zebedee  and john his brother  
3	philip  and bartholomew  thomas  and matthew the publican  james  the son  of alphaeus  and lebbaeus  whose surname was thaddaeus  
4	simon the canaanite  and judas iscariot  who also betrayed him  
5 	these twelve jesus sent forth  and commanded them  saying  go not into the way of the gentiles  and into  any  city of the samaritans enter ye not  
6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel  
7	and as ye go  preach  saying  the kingdom of heaven is at hand  
8	heal the sick  cleanse the lepers  raise the dead  cast out devils  freely ye have received  freely give  
9	provide neither gold  nor silver  nor brass in your purses  
10	nor scrip for  your  journey  neither two coats  neither shoes  nor yet staves  for the workman is worthy of his meat  
11	and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter  enquire who in it is worthy  and there abide till ye go thence  
12	and when ye come into an house  salute it  
13	and if the house be worthy  let your peace come upon it  but if it be not worthy  let your peace return to you  
14	and whosoever shall not receive you  nor hear your words  when ye depart out of that house or city  shake off the dust of your feet  
15	verily i say unto you  it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment  than for that city  
16 	behold  i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves  be ye therefore wise as serpents  and harmless as doves  
17	but beware of men  for they will deliver you up to the councils  and they will scourge you in their synagogues  
18	and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake  for a testimony against them and the gentiles  
19	but when they deliver you up  take no thought how or what ye shall speak  for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak  
20	for it is not ye that speak  but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you  
21	and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death  and the father the child  and the children shall rise up against  their  parents  and cause them to be put to death  
22	and ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name s sake  but he that endureth to the end shall be saved  
23	but when they persecute you in this city  flee ye into another  for verily i say unto you  ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel  till the son of man be come  
24	the disciple is not above  his  master  nor the servant above his lord  
25	it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master  and the servant as his lord  if they have called the master of the house beelzebub  how much more  shall they call  them of his household  
26	fear them not therefore  for there is nothing covered  that shall not be revealed  and hid  that shall not be known  
27	what i tell you in darkness   that  speak ye in light  and what ye hear in the ear   that  preach ye upon the housetops  
28	and fear not them which kill the body  but are not able to kill the soul  but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell  
29	are not two sparrows sold for a farthing  and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father  
30	but the very hairs of your head are all numbered  
31	fear ye not therefore  ye are of more value than many sparrows  
32	whosoever therefore shall confess me before men  him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven  
33	but whosoever shall deny me before men  him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven  
34	think not that i am come to send peace on earth  i came not to send peace  but a sword  
35	for i am come to set a man at variance against his father  and the daughter against her mother  and the daughter in law against her mother in law  
36	and a man s foes  shall be  they of his own household  
37	he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me  and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me  
38	and he that taketh not his cross  and followeth after me  is not worthy of me  
39	he that findeth his life shall lose it  and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it  
40	he that receiveth you receiveth me  and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me  
41	he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet s reward  and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man s reward  
42	and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold  water  only in the name of a disciple  verily i say unto you  he shall in no wise lose his reward  
matthew 11
1 	and it came to pass  when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples  he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities  
2	now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ  he sent two of his disciples  
3	and said unto him  art thou he that should come  or do we look for another  
4	jesus answered and said unto them  go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see  
5	the blind receive their sight  and the lame walk  the lepers are cleansed  and the deaf hear  the dead are raised up  and the poor have the gospel preached to them  
6	and blessed is  he   whosoever shall not be offended in me  
7 	and as they departed  jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john  what went ye out into the wilderness to see  a reed shaken with the wind  
8	but what went ye out for to see  a man clothed in soft raiment  behold  they that wear soft  clothing  are in kings  houses  
9	but what went ye out for to see  a prophet  yea  i say unto you  and more than a prophet  
10	for this is  he   of whom it is written  behold  i send my messenger before thy face  which shall prepare thy way before thee  
11	verily i say unto you  among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist  notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he  
12	and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence  and the violent take it by force  
13	for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john  
14	and if ye will receive  it   this is elias  which was for to come  
15	he that hath ears to hear  let him hear  
16 	but whereunto shall i liken this generation  it is like unto children sitting in the markets  and calling unto their fellows  
17	and saying  we have piped unto you  and ye have not danced  we have mourned unto you  and ye have not lamented  
18	for john came neither eating nor drinking  and they say  he hath a devil  
19	the son of man came eating and drinking  and they say  behold a man gluttonous  and a winebibber  a friend of publicans and sinners  but wisdom is justified of her children  
20	then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done  because they repented not  
21	woe unto thee  chorazin  woe unto thee  bethsaida  for if the mighty works  which were done in you  had been done in tyre and sidon  they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes  
22	but i say unto you  it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment  than for you  
23	and thou  capernaum  which art exalted unto heaven  shalt be brought down to hell  for if the mighty works  which have been done in thee  had been done in sodom  it would have remained until this day  
24	but i say unto you  that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment  than for thee  
25 	at that time jesus answered and said  i thank thee  o father  lord of heaven and earth  because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent  and hast revealed them unto babes  
26	even so  father  for so it seemed good in thy sight  
27	all things are delivered unto me of my father  and no man knoweth the son  but the father  neither knoweth any man the father  save the son  and  he  to whomsoever the son will reveal  him   
28	come unto me  all  ye  that labour and are heavy laden  and i will give you rest  
29	take my yoke upon you  and learn of me  for i am meek and lowly in heart  and ye shall find rest unto your souls  
30	for my yoke  is  easy  and my burden is light  
matthew 12
1 	at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn  and his disciples were an hungred  and began to pluck the ears of corn  and to eat  
2	but when the pharisees saw  it   they said unto him  behold  thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day  
3	but he said unto them  have ye not read what david did  when he was an hungred  and they that were with him  
4	how he entered into the house of god  and did eat the shewbread  which was not lawful for him to eat  neither for them which were with him  but only for the priests  
5	or have ye not read in the law  how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath  and are blameless  
6	but i say unto you  that in this place is  one  greater than the temple  
7	but if ye had known what  this  meaneth  i will have mercy  and not sacrifice  ye would not have condemned the guiltless  
8	for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day  
9	and when he was departed thence  he went into their synagogue  
10	and  behold  there was a man which had  his  hand withered  and they asked him  saying  is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days  that they might accuse him  
11	and he said unto them  what man shall there be among you  that shall have one sheep  and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day  will he not lay hold on it  and lift  it  out  
12	how much then is a man better than a sheep  wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days  
13	then saith he to the man  stretch forth thine hand  and he stretched  it  forth  and it was restored whole  like as the other  
14 	then the pharisees went out  and held a council against him  how they might destroy him  
15	but when jesus knew  it   he withdrew himself from thence  and great multitudes followed him  and he healed them all  
16	and charged them that they should not make him known  
17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet  saying  
18	behold my servant  whom i have chosen  my beloved  in whom my soul is well pleased  i will put my spirit upon him  and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles  
19	he shall not strive  nor cry  neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets  
20	a bruised reed shall he not break  and smoking flax shall he not quench  till he send forth judgment unto victory  
21	and in his name shall the gentiles trust  
22 	then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil  blind  and dumb  and he healed him  insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw  
23	and all the people were amazed  and said  is not this the son of david  
24	but when the pharisees heard  it   they said  this  fellow  doth not cast out devils  but by beelzebub the prince of the devils  
25	and jesus knew their thoughts  and said unto them  every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation  and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand  
26	and if satan cast out satan  he is divided against himself  how shall then his kingdom stand  
27	and if i by beelzebub cast out devils  by whom do your children cast  them  out  therefore they shall be your judges  
28	but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god  then the kingdom of god is come unto you  
29	or else how can one enter into a strong man s house  and spoil his goods  except he first bind the strong man  and then he will spoil his house  
30	he that is not with me is against me  and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad  
31	wherefore i say unto you  all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men  but the blasphemy  against  the  holy  ghost shall not be forgiven unto men  
32	and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man  it shall be forgiven him  but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost  it shall not be forgiven him  neither in this world  neither in the  world  to come  
33	either make the tree good  and his fruit good  or else make the tree corrupt  and his fruit corrupt  for the tree is known by  his  fruit  
34	o generation of vipers  how can ye  being evil  speak good things  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh  
35	a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things  and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things  
36	but i say unto you  that every idle word that men shall speak  they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment  
37	for by thy words thou shalt be justified  and by thy words thou shalt be condemned  
38 	then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered  saying  master  we would see a sign from thee  
39	but he answered and said unto them  an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign  and there shall no sign be given to it  but the sign of the prophet jonas  
40	for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale s belly  so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth  
41	the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation  and shall condemn it  because they repented at the preaching of jonas  and  behold  a greater than jonas  is  here  
42	the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation  and shall condemn it  for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon  and  behold  a greater than solomon  is  here  
43	when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man  he walketh through dry places  seeking rest  and findeth none  
44	then he saith  i will return into my house from whence i came out  and when he is come  he findeth  it  empty  swept  and garnished  
45	then goeth he  and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself  and they enter in and dwell there  and the last  state  of that man is worse than the first  even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation  
46 	while he yet talked to the people  behold   his  mother and his brethren stood without  desiring to speak with him  
47	then one said unto him  behold  thy mother and thy brethren stand without  desiring to speak with thee  
48	but he answered and said unto him that told him  who is my mother  and who are my brethren  
49	and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples  and said  behold my mother and my brethren  
50	for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven  the same is my brother  and sister  and mother  
matthew 13
1 	the same day went jesus out of the house  and sat by the sea side  
2	and great multitudes were gathered together unto him  so that he went into a ship  and sat  and the whole multitude stood on the shore  
3	and he spake many things unto them in parables  saying  behold  a sower went forth to sow  
4	and when he sowed  some  seeds  fell by the way side  and the fowls came and devoured them up  
5	some fell upon stony places  where they had not much earth  and forthwith they sprung up  because they had no deepness of earth  
6	and when the sun was up  they were scorched  and because they had no root  they withered away  
7	and some fell among thorns  and the thorns sprung up  and choked them  
8	but other fell into good ground  and brought forth fruit  some an hundredfold  some sixtyfold  some thirtyfold  
9	who hath ears to hear  let him hear  
10	and the disciples came  and said unto him  why speakest thou unto them in parables  
11	he answered and said unto them  because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven  but to them it is not given  
12	for whosoever hath  to him shall be given  and he shall have more abundance  but whosoever hath not  from him shall be taken away even that he hath  
13	therefore speak i to them in parables  because they seeing see not  and hearing they hear not  neither do they understand  
14	and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias  which saith  by hearing ye shall hear  and shall not understand  and seeing ye shall see  and shall not perceive  
15	for this people s heart is waxed gross  and  their  ears are dull of hearing  and their eyes they have closed  lest at any time they should see with  their  eyes  and hear with  their  ears  and should understand with  their  heart  and should be converted  and i should heal them  
16	but blessed  are  your eyes  for they see  and your ears  for they hear  
17	for verily i say unto you  that many prophets and righteous  men  have desired to see  those things  which ye see  and have not seen  them   and to hear  those things  which ye hear  and have not heard  them   
18	hear ye therefore the parable of the sower  
19	when any one heareth the word of the kingdom  and understandeth  it  not  then cometh the wicked  one   and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart  this is he which received seed by the way side  
20	but he that received the seed into stony places  the same is he that heareth the word  and anon with joy receiveth it  
21	yet hath he not root in himself  but dureth for a while  for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word  by and by he is offended  
22	he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word  and the care of this world  and the deceitfulness of riches  choke the word  and he becometh unfruitful  
23	but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word  and understandeth  it   which also beareth fruit  and bringeth forth  some an hundredfold  some sixty  some thirty  
24 	another parable put he forth unto them  saying  the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field  
25	but while men slept  his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat  and went his way  
26	but when the blade was sprung up  and brought forth fruit  then appeared the tares also  
27	so the servants of the householder came and said unto him  sir  didst not thou sow good seed in thy field  from whence then hath it tares  
28	he said unto them  an enemy hath done this  the servants said unto him  wilt thou then that we go and gather them up  
29	but he said  nay  lest while ye gather up the tares  ye root up also the wheat with them  
30	let both grow together until the harvest  and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers  gather ye together first the tares  and bind them in bundles to burn them  but gather the wheat into my barn  
31	another parable put he forth unto them  saying  the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed  which a man took  and sowed in his field  
32	which indeed is the least of all seeds  but when it is grown  it is the greatest among herbs  and becometh a tree  so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof  
33	another parable spake he unto them  the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven  which a woman took  and hid in three measures of meal  till the whole was leavened  
34	all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables  and without a parable spake he not unto them  
35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet  saying  i will open my mouth in parables  i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world  
36	then jesus sent the multitude away  and went into the house  and his disciples came unto him  saying  declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field  
37	he answered and said unto them  he that soweth the good seed is the son of man  
38	the field is the world  the good seed are the children of the kingdom  but the tares are the children of the wicked  one   
39	the enemy that sowed them is the devil  the harvest is the end of the world  and the reapers are the angels  
40	as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire  so shall it be in the end of this world  
41	the son of man shall send forth his angels  and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend  and them which do iniquity  
42	and shall cast them into a furnace of fire  there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth  
43	then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father  who hath ears to hear  let him hear  
44 	again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field  the which when a man hath found  he hideth  and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath  and buyeth that field  
45	again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man  seeking goodly pearls  
46	who  when he had found one pearl of great price  went and sold all that he had  and bought it  
47	again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net  that was cast into the sea  and gathered of every kind  
48	which  when it was full  they drew to shore  and sat down  and gathered the good into vessels  but cast the bad away  
49	so shall it be at the end of the world  the angels shall come forth  and sever the wicked from among the just  
50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire  there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth  
51	jesus saith unto them  have ye understood all these things  they say unto him  yea  lord  
52	then said he unto them  therefore every scribe  which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man  that is  an householder  which bringeth forth out of his treasure  things  new and old  
53 	and it came to pass   that  when jesus had finished these parables  he departed thence  
54	and when he was come into his own country  he taught them in their synagogue  insomuch that they were astonished  and said  whence hath this  man  this wisdom  and  these  mighty works  
55	is not this the carpenter s son  is not his mother called mary  and his brethren  james  and joses  and simon  and judas  
56	and his sisters  are they not all with us  whence then hath this  man  all these things  
57	and they were offended in him  but jesus said unto them  a prophet is not without honour  save in his own country  and in his own house  
58	and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief  
matthew 14
1 	at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus  
2	and said unto his servants  this is john the baptist  he is risen from the dead  and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him  
3	for herod had laid hold on john  and bound him  and put  him  in prison for herodias  sake  his brother philip s wife  
4	for john said unto him  it is not lawful for thee to have her  
5	and when he would have put him to death  he feared the multitude  because they counted him as a prophet  
6	but when herod s birthday was kept  the daughter of herodias danced before them  and pleased herod  
7	whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask  
8	and she  being before instructed of her mother  said  give me here john baptist s head in a charger  
9	and the king was sorry  nevertheless for the oath s sake  and them which sat with him at meat  he commanded  it  to be given  her   
10	and he sent  and beheaded john in the prison  
11	and his head was brought in a charger  and given to the damsel  and she brought  it  to her mother  
12	and his disciples came  and took up the body  and buried it  and went and told jesus  
13 	when jesus heard  of it   he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart  and when the people had heard  thereof   they followed him on foot out of the cities  
14	and jesus went forth  and saw a great multitude  and was moved with compassion toward them  and he healed their sick  
15	and when it was evening  his disciples came to him  saying  this is a desert place  and the time is now past  send the multitude away  that they may go into the villages  and buy themselves victuals  
16	but jesus said unto them  they need not depart  give ye them to eat  
17	and they say unto him  we have here but five loaves  and two fishes  
18	he said  bring them hither to me  
19	and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass  and took the five loaves  and the two fishes  and looking up to heaven  he blessed  and brake  and gave the loaves to  his  disciples  and the disciples to the multitude  
20	and they did all eat  and were filled  and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full  
21	and they that had eaten were about five thousand men  beside women and children  
22 	and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship  and to go before him unto the other side  while he sent the multitudes away  
23	and when he had sent the multitudes away  he went up into a mountain apart to pray  and when the evening was come  he was there alone  
24	but the ship was now in the midst of the sea  tossed with waves  for the wind was contrary  
25	and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them  walking on the sea  
26	and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea  they were troubled  saying  it is a spirit  and they cried out for fear  
27	but straightway jesus spake unto them  saying  be of good cheer  it is i  be not afraid  
28	and peter answered him and said  lord  if it be thou  bid me come unto thee on the water  
29	and he said  come  and when peter was come down out of the ship  he walked on the water  to go to jesus  
30	but when he saw the wind boisterous  he was afraid  and beginning to sink  he cried  saying  lord  save me  
31	and immediately jesus stretched forth  his  hand  and caught him  and said unto him  o thou of little faith  wherefore didst thou doubt  
32	and when they were come into the ship  the wind ceased  
33	then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him  saying  of a truth thou art the son of god  
34 	and when they were gone over  they came into the land of gennesaret  
35	and when the men of that place had knowledge of him  they sent out into all that country round about  and brought unto him all that were diseased  
36	and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment  and as many as touched were made perfectly whole  
matthew 15
1 	then came to jesus scribes and pharisees  which were of jerusalem  saying  
2	why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders  for they wash not their hands when they eat bread  
3	but he answered and said unto them  why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition  
4	for god commanded  saying  honour thy father and mother  and  he that curseth father or mother  let him die the death  
5	but ye say  whosoever shall say to  his  father or  his  mother   it is  a gift  by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me  
6	and honour not his father or his mother   he shall be free   thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition  
7	 ye  hypocrites  well did esaias prophesy of you  saying  
8	this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth  and honoureth me with  their  lips  but their heart is far from me  
9	but in vain they do worship me  teaching  for  doctrines the commandments of men  
10 	and he called the multitude  and said unto them  hear  and understand  
11	not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man  but that which cometh out of the mouth  this defileth a man  
12	then came his disciples  and said unto him  knowest thou that the pharisees were offended  after they heard this saying  
13	but he answered and said  every plant  which my heavenly father hath not planted  shall be rooted up  
14	let them alone  they be blind leaders of the blind  and if the blind lead the blind  both shall fall into the ditch  
15	then answered peter and said unto him  declare unto us this parable  
16	and jesus said  are ye also yet without understanding  
17	do not ye yet understand  that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly  and is cast out into the draught  
18	but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart  and they defile the man  
19	for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts  murders  adulteries  fornications  thefts  false witness  blasphemies  
20	these are  the things  which defile a man  but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man  
21 	then jesus went thence  and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon  
22	and  behold  a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts  and cried unto him  saying  have mercy on me  o lord   thou  son of david  my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil  
23	but he answered her not a word  and his disciples came and besought him  saying  send her away  for she crieth after us  
24	but he answered and said  i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel  
25	then came she and worshipped him  saying  lord  help me  
26	but he answered and said  it is not meet to take the children s bread  and to cast  it  to dogs  
27	and she said  truth  lord  yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters  table  
28	then jesus answered and said unto her  o woman  great  is  thy faith  be it unto thee even as thou wilt  and her daughter was made whole from that very hour  
29 	and jesus departed from thence  and came nigh unto the sea of galilee  and went up into a mountain  and sat down there  
30	and great multitudes came unto him  having with them  those that were  lame  blind  dumb  maimed  and many others  and cast them down at jesus  feet  and he healed them  
31	insomuch that the multitude wondered  when they saw the dumb to speak  the maimed to be whole  the lame to walk  and the blind to see  and they glorified the god of israel  
32	then jesus called his disciples  unto him   and said  i have compassion on the multitude  because they continue with me now three days  and have nothing to eat  and i will not send them away fasting  lest they faint in the way  
33	and his disciples say unto him  whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness  as to fill so great a multitude  
34	and jesus saith unto them  how many loaves have ye  and they said  seven  and a few little fishes  
35	and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground  
36	and he took the seven loaves and the fishes  and gave thanks  and brake  them   and gave to his disciples  and the disciples to the multitude  
37	and they did all eat  and were filled  and they took up of the broken  meat  that was left seven baskets full  
38	and they that did eat were four thousand men  beside women and children  
39	and he sent away the multitude  and took ship  and came into the coasts of magdala  
matthew 16
1 	the pharisees also with the sadducees came  and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven  
2	he answered and said unto them  when it is evening  ye say   it will be  fair weather  for the sky is red  
3	and in the morning   it will be  foul weather to day  for the sky is red and lowring  o  ye  hypocrites  ye can discern the face of the sky  but can ye not  discern  the signs of the times  
4	a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign  and there shall no sign be given unto it  but the sign of the prophet jonas  and he left them  and departed  
5 	and when his disciples were come to the other side  they had forgotten to take bread  
6	then jesus said unto them  take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees  
7	and they reasoned among themselves  saying   it is  because we have taken no bread  
8	 which  when jesus perceived  he said unto them  o ye of little faith  why reason ye among yourselves  because ye have brought no bread  
9	do ye not yet understand  neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand  and how many baskets ye took up  
10	neither the seven loaves of the four thousand  and how many baskets ye took up  
11	how is it that ye do not understand that i spake  it  not to you concerning bread  that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees  
12	then understood they how that he bade  them  not beware of the leaven of bread  but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees  
13 	when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi  he asked his disciples  saying  whom do men say that i the son of man am  
14	and they said  some  say that thou art  john the baptist  some  elias  and others  jeremias  or one of the prophets  
15	he saith unto them  but whom say ye that i am  
16	and simon peter answered and said  thou art the christ  the son of the living god  
17	and jesus answered and said unto him  blessed art thou  simon barjona  for flesh and blood hath not revealed  it  unto thee  but my father which is in heaven  
18	and i say also unto thee  that thou art peter  and upon this rock i will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  
19	and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven  and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven  and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven  
20	then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ  
21 	from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples  how that he must go unto jerusalem  and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes  and be killed  and be raised again the third day  
22	then peter took him  and began to rebuke him  saying  be it far from thee  lord  this shall not be unto thee  
23	but he turned  and said unto peter  get thee behind me  satan  thou art an offence unto me  for thou savourest not the things that be of god  but those that be of men  
24 	then said jesus unto his disciples  if any  man  will come after me  let him deny himself  and take up his cross  and follow me  
25	for whosoever will save his life shall lose it  and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it  
26	for what is a man profited  if he shall gain the whole world  and lose his own soul  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul  
27	for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels  and then he shall reward every man according to his works  
28	verily i say unto you  there be some standing here  which shall not taste of death  till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom  
matthew 17
1 	and after six days jesus taketh peter  james  and john his brother  and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart  
2	and was transfigured before them  and his face did shine as the sun  and his raiment was white as the light  
3	and  behold  there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him  
4	then answered peter  and said unto jesus  lord  it is good for us to be here  if thou wilt  let us make here three tabernacles  one for thee  and one for moses  and one for elias  
5	while he yet spake  behold  a bright cloud overshadowed them  and behold a voice out of the cloud  which said  this is my beloved son  in whom i am well pleased  hear ye him  
6	and when the disciples heard  it   they fell on their face  and were sore afraid  
7	and jesus came and touched them  and said  arise  and be not afraid  
8	and when they had lifted up their eyes  they saw no man  save jesus only  
9	and as they came down from the mountain  jesus charged them  saying  tell the vision to no man  until the son of man be risen again from the dead  
10	and his disciples asked him  saying  why then say the scribes that elias must first come  
11	and jesus answered and said unto them  elias truly shall first come  and restore all things  
12	but i say unto you  that elias is come already  and they knew him not  but have done unto him whatsoever they listed  likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them  
13	then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist  
14 	and when they were come to the multitude  there came to him a  certain  man  kneeling down to him  and saying  
15	lord  have mercy on my son  for he is lunatick  and sore vexed  for ofttimes he falleth into the fire  and oft into the water  
16	and i brought him to thy disciples  and they could not cure him  
17	then jesus answered and said  o faithless and perverse generation  how long shall i be with you  how long shall i suffer you  bring him hither to me  
18	and jesus rebuked the devil  and he departed out of him  and the child was cured from that very hour  
19	then came the disciples to jesus apart  and said  why could not we cast him out  
20	and jesus said unto them  because of your unbelief  for verily i say unto you  if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed  ye shall say unto this mountain  remove hence to yonder place  and it shall remove  and nothing shall be impossible unto you  
21	howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting  
22 	and while they abode in galilee  jesus said unto them  the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men  
23	and they shall kill him  and the third day he shall be raised again  and they were exceeding sorry  
24 	and when they were come to capernaum  they that received tribute  money  came to peter  and said  doth not your master pay tribute  
25	he saith  yes  and when he was come into the house  jesus prevented him  saying  what thinkest thou  simon  of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute  of their own children  or of strangers  
26	peter saith unto him  of strangers  jesus saith unto him  then are the children free  
27	notwithstanding  lest we should offend them  go thou to the sea  and cast an hook  and take up the fish that first cometh up  and when thou hast opened his mouth  thou shalt find a piece of money  that take  and give unto them for me and thee  
matthew 18
1 	at the same time came the disciples unto jesus  saying  who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven  
2	and jesus called a little child unto him  and set him in the midst of them  
3	and said  verily i say unto you  except ye be converted  and become as little children  ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven  
4	whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child  the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven  
5	and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me  
6	but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me  it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and  that  he were drowned in the depth of the sea  
7 	woe unto the world because of offences  for it must needs be that offences come  but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh  
8	wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee  cut them off  and cast  them  from thee  it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed  rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire  
9	and if thine eye offend thee  pluck it out  and cast  it  from thee  it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye  rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire  
10	take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones  for i say unto you  that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven  
11	for the son of man is come to save that which was lost  
12	how think ye  if a man have an hundred sheep  and one of them be gone astray  doth he not leave the ninety and nine  and goeth into the mountains  and seeketh that which is gone astray  
13	and if so be that he find it  verily i say unto you  he rejoiceth more of that  sheep   than of the ninety and nine which went not astray  
14	even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven  that one of these little ones should perish  
15 	moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee  go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone  if he shall hear thee  thou hast gained thy brother  
16	but if he will not hear  thee  then  take with thee one or two more  that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established  
17	and if he shall neglect to hear them  tell  it  unto the church  but if he neglect to hear the church  let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican  
18	verily i say unto you  whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven  and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven  
19	again i say unto you  that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask  it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven  
20	for where two or three are gathered together in my name  there am i in the midst of them  
21 	then came peter to him  and said  lord  how oft shall my brother sin against me  and i forgive him  till seven times  
22	jesus saith unto him  i say not unto thee  until seven times  but  until seventy times seven  
23	therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king  which would take account of his servants  
24	and when he had begun to reckon  one was brought unto him  which owed him ten thousand talents  
25	but forasmuch as he had not to pay  his lord commanded him to be sold  and his wife  and children  and all that he had  and payment to be made  
26	the servant therefore fell down  and worshipped him  saying  lord  have patience with me  and i will pay thee all  
27	then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion  and loosed him  and forgave him the debt  
28	but the same servant went out  and found one of his fellowservants  which owed him an hundred pence  and he laid hands on him  and took  him  by the throat  saying  pay me that thou owest  
29	and his fellowservant fell down at his feet  and besought him  saying  have patience with me  and i will pay thee all  
30	and he would not  but went and cast him into prison  till he should pay the debt  
31	so when his fellowservants saw what was done  they were very sorry  and came and told unto their lord all that was done  
32	then his lord  after that he had called him  said unto him  o thou wicked servant  i forgave thee all that debt  because thou desiredst me  
33	shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant  even as i had pity on thee  
34	and his lord was wroth  and delivered him to the tormentors  till he should pay all that was due unto him  
35	so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you  if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses  
matthew 19
1 	and it came to pass   that  when jesus had finished these sayings  he departed from galilee  and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan  
2	and great multitudes followed him  and he healed them there  
3 	the pharisees also came unto him  tempting him  and saying unto him  is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause  
4	and he answered and said unto them  have ye not read  that he which made  them  at the beginning made them male and female  
5	and said  for this cause shall a man leave father and mother  and shall cleave to his wife  and they twain shall be one flesh  
6	wherefore they are no more twain  but one flesh  what therefore god hath joined together  let not man put asunder  
7	they say unto him  why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement  and to put her away  
8	he saith unto them  moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives  but from the beginning it was not so  
9	and i say unto you  whosoever shall put away his wife  except  it be  for fornication  and shall marry another  committeth adultery  and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery  
10	his disciples say unto him  if the case of the man be so with  his  wife  it is not good to marry  
11	but he said unto them  all  men  cannot receive this saying  save  they  to whom it is given  
12	for there are some eunuchs  which were so born from  their  mother s womb  and there are some eunuchs  which were made eunuchs of men  and there be eunuchs  which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven s sake  he that is able to receive  it   let him receive  it   
13 	then were there brought unto him little children  that he should put  his  hands on them  and pray  and the disciples rebuked them  
14	but jesus said  suffer little children  and forbid them not  to come unto me  for of such is the kingdom of heaven  
15	and he laid  his  hands on them  and departed thence  
16 	and  behold  one came and said unto him  good master  what good thing shall i do  that i may have eternal life  
17	and he said unto him  why callest thou me good   there is  none good but one   that is   god  but if thou wilt enter into life  keep the commandments  
18	he saith unto him  which  jesus said  thou shalt do no murder  thou shalt not commit adultery  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not bear false witness  
19	honour thy father and  thy  mother  and  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  
20	the young man saith unto him  all these things have i kept from my youth up  what lack i yet  
21	jesus said unto him  if thou wilt be perfect  go  and  sell that thou hast  and give to the poor  and thou shalt have treasure in heaven  and come  and  follow me  
22	but when the young man heard that saying  he went away sorrowful  for he had great possessions  
23 	then said jesus unto his disciples  verily i say unto you  that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven  
24	and again i say unto you  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  
25	when his disciples heard  it   they were exceedingly amazed  saying  who then can be saved  
26	but jesus beheld  them   and said unto them  with men this is impossible  but with god all things are possible  
27	then answered peter and said unto him  behold  we have forsaken all  and followed thee  what shall we have therefore  
28	and jesus said unto them  verily i say unto you  that ye which have followed me  in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory  ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones  judging the twelve tribes of israel  
29	and every one that hath forsaken houses  or brethren  or sisters  or father  or mother  or wife  or children  or lands  for my name s sake  shall receive an hundredfold  and shall inherit everlasting life  
30	but many  that are  first shall be last  and the last  shall be  first  
matthew 20
1 	for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man  that is  an householder  which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard  
2	and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day  he sent them into his vineyard  
3	and he went out about the third hour  and saw others standing idle in the marketplace  
4	and said unto them  go ye also into the vineyard  and whatsoever is right i will give you  and they went their way  
5	again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour  and did likewise  
6	and about the eleventh hour he went out  and found others standing idle  and saith unto them  why stand ye here all the day idle  
7	they say unto him  because no man hath hired us  he saith unto them  go ye also into the vineyard  and whatsoever is right   that  shall ye receive  
8	so when even was come  the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward  call the labourers  and give them  their  hire  beginning from the last unto the first  
9	and when they came that  were hired  about the eleventh hour  they received every man a penny  
10	but when the first came  they supposed that they should have received more  and they likewise received every man a penny  
11	and when they had received  it   they murmured against the goodman of the house  
12	saying  these last have wrought  but  one hour  and thou hast made them equal unto us  which have borne the burden and heat of the day  
13	but he answered one of them  and said  friend  i do thee no wrong  didst not thou agree with me for a penny  
14	take  that  thine  is   and go thy way  i will give unto this last  even as unto thee  
15	is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own  is thine eye evil  because i am good  
16	so the last shall be first  and the first last  for many be called  but few chosen  
17 	and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way  and said unto them  
18	behold  we go up to jerusalem  and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes  and they shall condemn him to death  
19	and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock  and to scourge  and to crucify  him   and the third day he shall rise again  
20 	then came to him the mother of zebedee s children with her sons  worshipping  him   and desiring a certain thing of him  
21	and he said unto her  what wilt thou  she saith unto him  grant that these my two sons may sit  the one on thy right hand  and the other on the left  in thy kingdom  
22	but jesus answered and said  ye know not what ye ask  are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of  and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with  they say unto him  we are able  
23	and he saith unto them  ye shall drink indeed of my cup  and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with  but to sit on my right hand  and on my left  is not mine to give  but  it shall be given to them  for whom it is prepared of my father  
24	and when the ten heard  it   they were moved with indignation against the two brethren  
25	but jesus called them  unto him   and said  ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them  and they that are great exercise authority upon them  
26	but it shall not be so among you  but whosoever will be great among you  let him be your minister  
27	and whosoever will be chief among you  let him be your servant  
28	even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto  but to minister  and to give his life a ransom for many  
29 	and as they departed from jericho  a great multitude followed him  
30	and  behold  two blind men sitting by the way side  when they heard that jesus passed by  cried out  saying  have mercy on us  o lord   thou  son of david  
31	and the multitude rebuked them  because they should hold their peace  but they cried the more  saying  have mercy on us  o lord   thou  son of david  
32	and jesus stood still  and called them  and said  what will ye that i shall do unto you  
33	they say unto him  lord  that our eyes may be opened  
34	so jesus had compassion  on them   and touched their eyes  and immediately their eyes received sight  and they followed him  
matthew 21
1 	and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem  and were come to bethphage  unto the mount of olives  then sent jesus two disciples  
2	saying unto them  go into the village over against you  and straightway ye shall find an ass tied  and a colt with her  loose  them   and bring  them  unto me  
3	and if any  man  say ought unto you  ye shall say  the lord hath need of them  and straightway he will send them  
4	all this was done  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet  saying  
5	tell ye the daughter of sion  behold  thy king cometh unto thee  meek  and sitting upon an ass  and a colt the foal of an ass  
6	and the disciples went  and did as jesus commanded them  
7	and brought the ass  and the colt  and put on them their clothes  and they set  him  thereon  
8	and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way  others cut down branches from the trees  and strawed  them  in the way  
9	and the multitudes that went before  and that followed  cried  saying  hosanna to the son of david  blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the lord  hosanna in the highest  
10	and when he was come into jerusalem  all the city was moved  saying  who is this  
11	and the multitude said  this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee  
12 	and jesus went into the temple of god  and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple  and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers  and the seats of them that sold doves  
13	and said unto them  it is written  my house shall be called the house of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thieves  
14	and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple  and he healed them  
15	and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did  and the children crying in the temple  and saying  hosanna to the son of david  they were sore displeased  
16	and said unto him  hearest thou what these say  and jesus saith unto them  yea  have ye never read  out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise  
17	and he left them  and went out of the city into bethany  and he lodged there  
18 	now in the morning as he returned into the city  he hungered  
19	and when he saw a fig tree in the way  he came to it  and found nothing thereon  but leaves only  and said unto it  let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever  and presently the fig tree withered away  
20	and when the disciples saw  it   they marvelled  saying  how soon is the fig tree withered away  
21	jesus answered and said unto them  verily i say unto you  if ye have faith  and doubt not  ye shall not only do this  which is done  to the fig tree  but also if ye shall say unto this mountain  be thou removed  and be thou cast into the sea  it shall be done  
22	and all things  whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer  believing  ye shall receive  
23 	and when he was come into the temple  the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching  and said  by what authority doest thou these things  and who gave thee this authority  
24	and jesus answered and said unto them  i also will ask you one thing  which if ye tell me  i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things  
25	the baptism of john  whence was it  from heaven  or of men  and they reasoned with themselves  saying  if we shall say  from heaven  he will say unto us  why did ye not then believe him  
26	but if we shall say  of men  we fear the people  for all hold john as a prophet  
27	and they answered jesus  and said  we cannot tell  and he said unto them  neither tell i you by what authority i do these things  
28 	but what think ye  a  certain  man had two sons  and he came to the first  and said  son  go work to day in my vineyard  
29	he answered and said  i will not  but afterward he repented  and went  
30	and he came to the second  and said likewise  and he answered and said  i  go   sir  and went not  
31	whether of them twain did the will of  his  father  they say unto him  the first  jesus saith unto them  verily i say unto you  that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you  
32	for john came unto you in the way of righteousness  and ye believed him not  but the publicans and the harlots believed him  and ye  when ye had seen  it   repented not afterward  that ye might believe him  
33 	hear another parable  there was a certain householder  which planted a vineyard  and hedged it round about  and digged a winepress in it  and built a tower  and let it out to husbandmen  and went into a far country  
34	and when the time of the fruit drew near  he sent his servants to the husbandmen  that they might receive the fruits of it  
35	and the husbandmen took his servants  and beat one  and killed another  and stoned another  
36	again  he sent other servants more than the first  and they did unto them likewise  
37	but last of all he sent unto them his son  saying  they will reverence my son  
38	but when the husbandmen saw the son  they said among themselves  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  and let us seize on his inheritance  
39	and they caught him  and cast  him  out of the vineyard  and slew  him   
40	when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh  what will he do unto those husbandmen  
41	they say unto him  he will miserably destroy those wicked men  and will let out  his  vineyard unto other husbandmen  which shall render him the fruits in their seasons  
42	jesus saith unto them  did ye never read in the scriptures  the stone which the builders rejected  the same is become the head of the corner  this is the lord s doing  and it is marvellous in our eyes  
43	therefore say i unto you  the kingdom of god shall be taken from you  and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof  
44	and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken  but on whomsoever it shall fall  it will grind him to powder  
45	and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables  they perceived that he spake of them  
46	but when they sought to lay hands on him  they feared the multitude  because they took him for a prophet  
matthew 22
1 	and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables  and said  
2	the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king  which made a marriage for his son  
3	and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding  and they would not come  
4	again  he sent forth other servants  saying  tell them which are bidden  behold  i have prepared my dinner  my oxen and  my  fatlings  are  killed  and all things  are  ready  come unto the marriage  
5	but they made light of  it   and went their ways  one to his farm  another to his merchandise  
6	and the remnant took his servants  and entreated  them  spitefully  and slew  them   
7	but when the king heard  thereof   he was wroth  and he sent forth his armies  and destroyed those murderers  and burned up their city  
8	then saith he to his servants  the wedding is ready  but they which were bidden were not worthy  
9	go ye therefore into the highways  and as many as ye shall find  bid to the marriage  
10	so those servants went out into the highways  and gathered together all as many as they found  both bad and good  and the wedding was furnished with guests  
11	and when the king came in to see the guests  he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment  
12	and he saith unto him  friend  how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment  and he was speechless  
13	then said the king to the servants  bind him hand and foot  and take him away  and cast  him  into outer darkness  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  
14	for many are called  but few  are  chosen  
15 	then went the pharisees  and took counsel how they might entangle him in  his  talk  
16	and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians  saying  master  we know that thou art true  and teachest the way of god in truth  neither carest thou for any  man   for thou regardest not the person of men  
17	tell us therefore  what thinkest thou  is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar  or not  
18	but jesus perceived their wickedness  and said  why tempt ye me   ye  hypocrites  
19	shew me the tribute money  and they brought unto him a penny  
20	and he saith unto them  whose  is  this image and superscription  
21	they say unto him  caesar s  then saith he unto them  render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar s  and unto god the things that are god s  
22	when they had heard  these words   they marvelled  and left him  and went their way  
23 	the same day came to him the sadducees  which say that there is no resurrection  and asked him  
24	saying  master  moses said  if a man die  having no children  his brother shall marry his wife  and raise up seed unto his brother  
25	now there were with us seven brethren  and the first  when he had married a wife  deceased  and  having no issue  left his wife unto his brother  
26	likewise the second also  and the third  unto the seventh  
27	and last of all the woman died also  
28	therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven  for they all had her  
29	jesus answered and said unto them  ye do err  not knowing the scriptures  nor the power of god  
30	for in the resurrection they neither marry  nor are given in marriage  but are as the angels of god in heaven  
31	but as touching the resurrection of the dead  have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god  saying  
32	i am the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  god is not the god of the dead  but of the living  
33	and when the multitude heard  this   they were astonished at his doctrine  
34 	but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence  they were gathered together  
35	then one of them   which was  a lawyer  asked  him a question   tempting him  and saying  
36	master  which  is  the great commandment in the law  
37	jesus said unto him  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart  and with all thy soul  and with all thy mind  
38	this is the first and great commandment  
39	and the second  is  like unto it  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  
40	on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets  
41 	while the pharisees were gathered together  jesus asked them  
42	saying  what think ye of christ  whose son is he  they say unto him   the son  of david  
43	he saith unto them  how then doth david in spirit call him lord  saying  
44	the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine enemies thy footstool  
45	if david then call him lord  how is he his son  
46	and no man was able to answer him a word  neither durst any  man  from that day forth ask him any more  questions   
matthew 23
1 	then spake jesus to the multitude  and to his disciples  
2	saying  the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses  seat  
3	all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe   that  observe and do  but do not ye after their works  for they say  and do not  
4	for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne  and lay  them  on men s shoulders  but they  themselves  will not move them with one of their fingers  
5	but all their works they do for to be seen of men  they make broad their phylacteries  and enlarge the borders of their garments  
6	and love the uppermost rooms at feasts  and the chief seats in the synagogues  
7	and greetings in the markets  and to be called of men  rabbi  rabbi  
8	but be not ye called rabbi  for one is your master   even  christ  and all ye are brethren  
9	and call no  man  your father upon the earth  for one is your father  which is in heaven  
10	neither be ye called masters  for one is your master   even  christ  
11	but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant  
12	and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased  and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted  
13 	but woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men  for ye neither go in  yourselves   neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in  
14	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye devour widows  houses  and for a pretence make long prayer  therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation  
15	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte  and when he is made  ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves  
16	woe unto you   ye  blind guides  which say  whosoever shall swear by the temple  it is nothing  but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple  he is a debtor  
17	 ye  fools and blind  for whether is greater  the gold  or the temple that sanctifieth the gold  
18	and  whosoever shall swear by the altar  it is nothing  but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it  he is guilty  
19	 ye  fools and blind  for whether  is  greater  the gift  or the altar that sanctifieth the gift  
20	whoso therefore shall swear by the altar  sweareth by it  and by all things thereon  
21	and whoso shall swear by the temple  sweareth by it  and by him that dwelleth therein  
22	and he that shall swear by heaven  sweareth by the throne of god  and by him that sitteth thereon  
23	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin  and have omitted the weightier  matters  of the law  judgment  mercy  and faith  these ought ye to have done  and not to leave the other undone  
24	 ye  blind guides  which strain at a gnat  and swallow a camel  
25	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter  but within they are full of extortion and excess  
26	 thou  blind pharisee  cleanse first that  which is  within the cup and platter  that the outside of them may be clean also  
27	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye are like unto whited sepulchres  which indeed appear beautiful outward  but are within full of dead  men s  bones  and of all uncleanness  
28	even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men  but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity  
29	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  because ye build the tombs of the prophets  and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous  
30	and say  if we had been in the days of our fathers  we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets  
31	wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves  that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets  
32	fill ye up then the measure of your fathers  
33	 ye  serpents   ye  generation of vipers  how can ye escape the damnation of hell  
34 	wherefore  behold  i send unto you prophets  and wise men  and scribes  and  some  of them ye shall kill and crucify  and  some  of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues  and persecute  them  from city to city  
35	that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth  from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias  whom ye slew between the temple and the altar  
36	verily i say unto you  all these things shall come upon this generation  
37	o jerusalem  jerusalem   thou  that killest the prophets  and stonest them which are sent unto thee  how often would i have gathered thy children together  even as a hen gathereth her chickens under  her  wings  and ye would not  
38	behold  your house is left unto you desolate  
39	for i say unto you  ye shall not see me henceforth  till ye shall say  blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the lord  
matthew 24
1 	and jesus went out  and departed from the temple  and his disciples came to  him  for to shew him the buildings of the temple  
2	and jesus said unto them  see ye not all these things  verily i say unto you  there shall not be left here one stone upon another  that shall not be thrown down  
3	and as he sat upon the mount of olives  the disciples came unto him privately  saying  tell us  when shall these things be  and what  shall be  the sign of thy coming  and of the end of the world  
4 	and jesus answered and said unto them  take heed that no man deceive you  
5	for many shall come in my name  saying  i am christ  and shall deceive many  
6	and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars  see that ye be not troubled  for all  these things  must come to pass  but the end is not yet  
7	for nation shall rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  and there shall be famines  and pestilences  and earthquakes  in divers places  
8	all these  are  the beginning of sorrows  
9	then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted  and shall kill you  and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name s sake  
10	and then shall many be offended  and shall betray one another  and shall hate one another  
11	and many false prophets shall rise  and shall deceive many  
12	and because iniquity shall abound  the love of many shall wax cold  
13	but he that shall endure unto the end  the same shall be saved  
14	and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations  and then shall the end come  
15	when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation  spoken of by daniel the prophet  stand in the holy place   whoso readeth  let him understand   
16	then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains  
17	let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house  
18	neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes  
19	and woe unto them that are with child  and to them that give suck in those days  
20	but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter  neither on the sabbath day  
21	for then shall be great tribulation  such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time  no  nor ever shall be  
22	and except those days should be shortened  there should no flesh be saved  but for the elect s sake those days shall be shortened  
23	then if any man shall say unto you  lo  here  is  christ  or there  believe  it  not  
24	for there shall arise false christs  and false prophets  and shall shew great signs and wonders  insomuch that  if  it were  possible  they shall deceive the very elect  
25	behold  i have told you before  
26	wherefore if they shall say unto you  behold  he is in the desert  go not forth  behold   he is  in the secret chambers  believe  it  not  
27	for as the lightning cometh out of the east  and shineth even unto the west  so shall also the coming of the son of man be  
28	for wheresoever the carcase is  there will the eagles be gathered together  
29	immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened  and the moon shall not give her light  and the stars shall fall from heaven  and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken  
30	and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven  and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn  and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory  
31	and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet  and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds  from one end of heaven to the other  
32 	now learn a parable of the fig tree  when his branch is yet tender  and putteth forth leaves  ye know that summer  is  nigh  
33	so likewise ye  when ye shall see all these things  know that it is near   even  at the doors  
34	verily i say unto you  this generation shall not pass  till all these things be fulfilled  
35	heaven and earth shall pass away  but my words shall not pass away  
36	but of that day and hour knoweth no  man   no  not the angels of heaven  but my father only  
37	but as the days of noe  were   so shall also the coming of the son of man be  
38	for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking  marrying and giving in marriage  until the day that noe entered into the ark  
39	and knew not until the flood came  and took them all away  so shall also the coming of the son of man be  
40	then shall two be in the field  the one shall be taken  and the other left  
41	two  women shall be  grinding at the mill  the one shall be taken  and the other left  
42	watch therefore  for ye know not what hour your lord doth come  
43	but know this  that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come  he would have watched  and would not have suffered his house to be broken up  
44	therefore be ye also ready  for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh  
45	who then is a faithful and wise servant  whom his lord hath made ruler over his household  to give them meat in due season  
46	blessed  is  that servant  whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing  
47	verily i say unto you  that he shall make him ruler over all his goods  
48	but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart  my lord delayeth his coming  
49	and shall begin to smite  his  fellowservants  and to eat and drink with the drunken  
50	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for  him   and in an hour that he is not aware of  
51	and shall cut him asunder  and appoint  him  his portion with the hypocrites  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  
matthew 25
1 	then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins  which took their lamps  and went forth to meet the bridegroom  
2	and five of them were wise  and five  were  foolish  
3	they that  were  foolish took their lamps  and took no oil with them  
4	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps  
5	while the bridegroom tarried  they all slumbered and slept  
6	and at midnight there was a cry made  behold  the bridegroom cometh  go ye out to meet him  
7	then all those virgins arose  and trimmed their lamps  
8	and the foolish said unto the wise  give us of your oil  for our lamps are gone out  
9	but the wise answered  saying   not so   lest there be not enough for us and you  but go ye rather to them that sell  and buy for yourselves  
10	and while they went to buy  the bridegroom came  and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage  and the door was shut  
11	afterward came also the other virgins  saying  lord  lord  open to us  
12	but he answered and said  verily i say unto you  i know you not  
13	watch therefore  for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh  
14 	for  the kingdom of heaven is  as a man travelling into a far country   who  called his own servants  and delivered unto them his goods  
15	and unto one he gave five talents  to another two  and to another one  to every man according to his several ability  and straightway took his journey  
16	then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same  and made  them  other five talents  
17	and likewise he that  had received  two  he also gained other two  
18	but he that had received one went and digged in the earth  and hid his lord s money  
19	after a long time the lord of those servants cometh  and reckoneth with them  
20	and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents  saying  lord  thou deliveredst unto me five talents  behold  i have gained beside them five talents more  
21	his lord said unto him  well done   thou  good and faithful servant  thou hast been faithful over a few things  i will make thee ruler over many things  enter thou into the joy of thy lord  
22	he also that had received two talents came and said  lord  thou deliveredst unto me two talents  behold  i have gained two other talents beside them  
23	his lord said unto him  well done  good and faithful servant  thou hast been faithful over a few things  i will make thee ruler over many things  enter thou into the joy of thy lord  
24	then he which had received the one talent came and said  lord  i knew thee that thou art an hard man  reaping where thou hast not sown  and gathering where thou hast not strawed  
25	and i was afraid  and went and hid thy talent in the earth  lo   there  thou hast  that is  thine  
26	his lord answered and said unto him   thou  wicked and slothful servant  thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not  and gather where i have not strawed  
27	thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers  and  then  at my coming i should have received mine own with usury  
28	take therefore the talent from him  and give  it  unto him which hath ten talents  
29	for unto every one that hath shall be given  and he shall have abundance  but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath  
30	and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  
31 	when the son of man shall come in his glory  and all the holy angels with him  then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory  
32	and before him shall be gathered all nations  and he shall separate them one from another  as a shepherd divideth  his  sheep from the goats  
33	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand  but the goats on the left  
34	then shall the king say unto them on his right hand  come  ye blessed of my father  inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  
35	for i was an hungred  and ye gave me meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave me drink  i was a stranger  and ye took me in  
36	naked  and ye clothed me  i was sick  and ye visited me  i was in prison  and ye came unto me  
37	then shall the righteous answer him  saying  lord  when saw we thee an hungred  and fed  thee   or thirsty  and gave  thee  drink  
38	when saw we thee a stranger  and took  thee  in  or naked  and clothed  thee   
39	or when saw we thee sick  or in prison  and came unto thee  
40	and the king shall answer and say unto them  verily i say unto you  inasmuch as ye have done  it  unto one of the least of these my brethren  ye have done  it  unto me  
41	then shall he say also unto them on the left hand  depart from me  ye cursed  into everlasting fire  prepared for the devil and his angels  
42	for i was an hungred  and ye gave me no meat  i was thirsty  and ye gave me no drink  
43	i was a stranger  and ye took me not in  naked  and ye clothed me not  sick  and in prison  and ye visited me not  
44	then shall they also answer him  saying  lord  when saw we thee an hungred  or athirst  or a stranger  or naked  or sick  or in prison  and did not minister unto thee  
45	then shall he answer them  saying  verily i say unto you  inasmuch as ye did  it  not to one of the least of these  ye did  it  not to me  
46	and these shall go away into everlasting punishment  but the righteous into life eternal  
matthew 26
1 	and it came to pass  when jesus had finished all these sayings  he said unto his disciples  
2	ye know that after two days is  the feast of  the passover  and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified  
3	then assembled together the chief priests  and the scribes  and the elders of the people  unto the palace of the high priest  who was called caiaphas  
4	and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty  and kill  him   
5	but they said  not on the feast  day   lest there be an uproar among the people  
6 	now when jesus was in bethany  in the house of simon the leper  
7	there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment  and poured it on his head  as he sat  at meat   
8	but when his disciples saw  it   they had indignation  saying  to what purpose  is  this waste  
9	for this ointment might have been sold for much  and given to the poor  
10	when jesus understood  it   he said unto them  why trouble ye the woman  for she hath wrought a good work upon me  
11	for ye have the poor always with you  but me ye have not always  
12	for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body  she did  it  for my burial  
13	verily i say unto you  wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world   there  shall also this  that this woman hath done  be told for a memorial of her  
14 	then one of the twelve  called judas iscariot  went unto the chief priests  
15	and said  unto them   what will ye give me  and i will deliver him unto you  and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver  
16	and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him  
17 	now the first  day  of the  feast of  unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus  saying unto him  where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover  
18	and he said  go into the city to such a man  and say unto him  the master saith  my time is at hand  i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples  
19	and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them  and they made ready the passover  
20	now when the even was come  he sat down with the twelve  
21	and as they did eat  he said  verily i say unto you  that one of you shall betray me  
22	and they were exceeding sorrowful  and began every one of them to say unto him  lord  is it i  
23	and he answered and said  he that dippeth  his  hand with me in the dish  the same shall betray me  
24	the son of man goeth as it is written of him  but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed  it had been good for that man if he had not been born  
25	then judas  which betrayed him  answered and said  master  is it i  he said unto him  thou hast said  
26 	and as they were eating  jesus took bread  and blessed  it   and brake  it   and gave  it  to the disciples  and said  take  eat  this is my body  
27	and he took the cup  and gave thanks  and gave  it  to them  saying  drink ye all of it  
28	for this is my blood of the new testament  which is shed for many for the remission of sins  
29	but i say unto you  i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine  until that day when i drink it new with you in my father s kingdom  
30	and when they had sung an hymn  they went out into the mount of olives  
31 	then saith jesus unto them  all ye shall be offended because of me this night  for it is written  i will smite the shepherd  and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad  
32	but after i am risen again  i will go before you into galilee  
33	peter answered and said unto him  though all  men  shall be offended because of thee   yet  will i never be offended  
34	jesus said unto him  verily i say unto thee  that this night  before the cock crow  thou shalt deny me thrice  
35	peter said unto him  though i should die with thee  yet will i not deny thee  likewise also said all the disciples  
36 	then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane  and saith unto the disciples  sit ye here  while i go and pray yonder  
37	and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee  and began to be sorrowful and very heavy  
38	then saith he unto them  my soul is exceeding sorrowful  even unto death  tarry ye here  and watch with me  
39	and he went a little further  and fell on his face  and prayed  saying  o my father  if it be possible  let this cup pass from me  nevertheless not as i will  but as thou  wilt   
40	and he cometh unto the disciples  and findeth them asleep  and saith unto peter  what  could ye not watch with me one hour  
41	watch and pray  that ye enter not into temptation  the spirit indeed  is  willing  but the flesh  is  weak  
42	he went away again the second time  and prayed  saying  o my father  if this cup may not pass away from me  except i drink it  thy will be done  
43	and he came and found them asleep again  for their eyes were heavy  
44	and he left them  and went away again  and prayed the third time  saying the same words  
45	then cometh he to his disciples  and saith unto them  sleep on now  and take  your  rest  behold  the hour is at hand  and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners  
46	rise  let us be going  behold  he is at hand that doth betray me  
47 	and while he yet spake  lo  judas  one of the twelve  came  and with him a great multitude with swords and staves  from the chief priests and elders of the people  
48	now he that betrayed him gave them a sign  saying  whomsoever i shall kiss  that same is he  hold him fast  
49	and forthwith he came to jesus  and said  hail  master  and kissed him  
50	and jesus said unto him  friend  wherefore art thou come  then came they  and laid hands on jesus  and took him  
51	and  behold  one of them which were with jesus stretched out  his  hand  and drew his sword  and struck a servant of the high priest s  and smote off his ear  
52	then said jesus unto him  put up again thy sword into his place  for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword  
53	thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father  and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels  
54	but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled  that thus it must be  
55	in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes  are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me  i sat daily with you teaching in the temple  and ye laid no hold on me  
56	but all this was done  that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled  then all the disciples forsook him  and fled  
57 	and they that had laid hold on jesus led  him  away to caiaphas the high priest  where the scribes and the elders were assembled  
58	but peter followed him afar off unto the high priest s palace  and went in  and sat with the servants  to see the end  
59	now the chief priests  and elders  and all the council  sought false witness against jesus  to put him to death  
60	but found none  yea  though many false witnesses came   yet  found they none  at the last came two false witnesses  
61	and said  this  fellow  said  i am able to destroy the temple of god  and to build it in three days  
62	and the high priest arose  and said unto him  answerest thou nothing  what  is it which  these witness against thee  
63	but jesus held his peace  and the high priest answered and said unto him  i adjure thee by the living god  that thou tell us whether thou be the christ  the son of god  
64	jesus saith unto him  thou hast said  nevertheless i say unto you  hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power  and coming in the clouds of heaven  
65	then the high priest rent his clothes  saying  he hath spoken blasphemy  what further need have we of witnesses  behold  now ye have heard his blasphemy  
66	what think ye  they answered and said  he is guilty of death  
67	then did they spit in his face  and buffeted him  and others smote  him  with the palms of their hands  
68	saying  prophesy unto us  thou christ  who is he that smote thee  
69 	now peter sat without in the palace  and a damsel came unto him  saying  thou also wast with jesus of galilee  
70	but he denied before  them  all  saying  i know not what thou sayest  
71	and when he was gone out into the porch  another  maid  saw him  and said unto them that were there  this  fellow  was also with jesus of nazareth  
72	and again he denied with an oath  i do not know the man  
73	and after a while came unto  him  they that stood by  and said to peter  surely thou also art  one  of them  for thy speech bewrayeth thee  
74	then began he to curse and to swear   saying   i know not the man  and immediately the cock crew  
75	and peter remembered the word of jesus  which said unto him  before the cock crow  thou shalt deny me thrice  and he went out  and wept bitterly  
matthew 27
1 	when the morning was come  all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death  
2	and when they had bound him  they led  him  away  and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor  
3	then judas  which had betrayed him  when he saw that he was condemned  repented himself  and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders  
4	saying  i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood  and they said  what  is that  to us  see thou  to that   
5	and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple  and departed  and went and hanged himself  
6	and the chief priests took the silver pieces  and said  it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury  because it is the price of blood  
7	and they took counsel  and bought with them the potter s field  to bury strangers in  
8	wherefore that field was called  the field of blood  unto this day  
9	then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet  saying  and they took the thirty pieces of silver  the price of him that was valued  whom they of the children of israel did value  
10	and gave them for the potter s field  as the lord appointed me  
11 	and jesus stood before the governor  and the governor asked him  saying  art thou the king of the jews  and jesus said unto him  thou sayest  
12	and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders  he answered nothing  
13	then said pilate unto him  hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee  
14	and he answered him to never a word  insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly  
15	now at  that  feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner  whom they would  
16	and they had then a notable prisoner  called barabbas  
17	therefore when they were gathered together  pilate said unto them  whom will ye that i release unto you  barabbas  or jesus which is called christ  
18	for he knew that for envy they had delivered him  
19	when he was set down on the judgment seat  his wife sent unto him  saying  have thou nothing to do with that just man  for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him  
20	but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas  and destroy jesus  
21	the governor answered and said unto them  whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you  they said  barabbas  
22	pilate saith unto them  what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ   they  all say unto him  let him be crucified  
23	and the governor said  why  what evil hath he done  but they cried out the more  saying  let him be crucified  
24	when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing  but  that  rather a tumult was made  he took water  and washed  his  hands before the multitude  saying  i am innocent of the blood of this just person  see ye  to it   
25	then answered all the people  and said  his blood  be  on us  and on our children  
26 	then released he barabbas unto them  and when he had scourged jesus  he delivered  him  to be crucified  
27	then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall  and gathered unto him the whole band  of soldiers   
28	and they stripped him  and put on him a scarlet robe  
29	and when they had platted a crown of thorns  they put  it  upon his head  and a reed in his right hand  and they bowed the knee before him  and mocked him  saying  hail  king of the jews  
30	and they spit upon him  and took the reed  and smote him on the head  
31	and after that they had mocked him  they took the robe off from him  and put his own raiment on him  and led him away to crucify  him   
32	and as they came out  they found a man of cyrene  simon by name  him they compelled to bear his cross  
33 	and when they were come unto a place called golgotha  that is to say  a place of a skull  
34	they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall  and when he had tasted  thereof   he would not drink  
35	and they crucified him  and parted his garments  casting lots  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet  they parted my garments among them  and upon my vesture did they cast lots  
36	and sitting down they watched him there  
37	and set up over his head his accusation written  this is jesus the king of the jews  
38	then were there two thieves crucified with him  one on the right hand  and another on the left  
39	and they that passed by reviled him  wagging their heads  
40	and saying  thou that destroyest the temple  and buildest  it  in three days  save thyself  if thou be the son of god  come down from the cross  
41	likewise also the chief priests mocking  him   with the scribes and elders  said  
42	he saved others  himself he cannot save  if he be the king of israel  let him now come down from the cross  and we will believe him  
43	he trusted in god  let him deliver him now  if he will have him  for he said  i am the son of god  
44	the thieves also  which were crucified with him  cast the same in his teeth  
45	now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour  
46	and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice  saying  eli  eli  lama sabachthani  that is to say  my god  my god  why hast thou forsaken me  
47	some of them that stood there  when they heard  that   said  this  man  calleth for elias  
48	and straightway one of them ran  and took a spunge  and filled  it  with vinegar  and put  it  on a reed  and gave him to drink  
49	the rest said  let be  let us see whether elias will come to save him  
50 	jesus  when he had cried again with a loud voice  yielded up the ghost  
51	and  behold  the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom  and the earth did quake  and the rocks rent  
52	and the graves were opened  and many bodies of the saints which slept arose  
53	and came out of the graves after his resurrection  and went into the holy city  and appeared unto many  
54	now when the centurion  and they that were with him  watching jesus  saw the earthquake  and those things that were done  they feared greatly  saying  truly this was the son of god  
55	and many women were there beholding afar off  which followed jesus from galilee  ministering unto him  
56	among which was mary magdalene  and mary the mother of james and joses  and the mother of zebedee s children  
57 	when the even was come  there came a rich man of arimathaea  named joseph  who also himself was jesus  disciple  
58	he went to pilate  and begged the body of jesus  then pilate commanded the body to be delivered  
59	and when joseph had taken the body  he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth  
60	and laid it in his own new tomb  which he had hewn out in the rock  and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre  and departed  
61	and there was mary magdalene  and the other mary  sitting over against the sepulchre  
62	now the next day  that followed the day of the preparation  the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate  
63	saying  sir  we remember that that deceiver said  while he was yet alive  after three days i will rise again  
64	command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day  lest his disciples come by night  and steal him away  and say unto the people  he is risen from the dead  so the last error shall be worse than the first  
65	pilate said unto them  ye have a watch  go your way  make  it  as sure as ye can  
66	so they went  and made the sepulchre sure  sealing the stone  and setting a watch  
matthew 28
1 	in the end of the sabbath  as it began to dawn toward the first  day  of the week  came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre  
2	and  behold  there was a great earthquake  for the angel of the lord descended from heaven  and came and rolled back the stone from the door  and sat upon it  
3	his countenance was like lightning  and his raiment white as snow  
4	and for fear of him the keepers did shake  and became as dead  men   
5	and the angel answered and said unto the women  fear not ye  for i know that ye seek jesus  which was crucified  
6	he is not here  for he is risen  as he said  come  see the place where the lord lay  
7	and go quickly  and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead  and  behold  he goeth before you into galilee  there shall ye see him  lo  i have told you  
8	and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy  and did run to bring his disciples word  
9	and as they went to tell his disciples  behold  jesus met them  saying  all hail  and they came and held him by the feet  and worshipped him  
10	then said jesus unto them  be not afraid  go tell my brethren that they go into galilee  and there shall they see me  
11 	now when they were going  behold  some of the watch came into the city  and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done  
12	and when they were assembled with the elders  and had taken counsel  they gave large money unto the soldiers  
13	saying  say ye  his disciples came by night  and stole him  away  while we slept  
14	and if this come to the governor s ears  we will persuade him  and secure you  
15	so they took the money  and did as they were taught  and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day  
16 	then the eleven disciples went away into galilee  into a mountain where jesus had appointed them  
17	and when they saw him  they worshipped him  but some doubted  
18	and jesus came and spake unto them  saying  all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth  
19	go ye therefore  and teach all nations  baptizing them in the name of the father  and of the son  and of the holy ghost  
20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you  and  lo  i am with you alway   even  unto the end of the world  amen  

mark
mark 1
1 	the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ  the son of god  
2	as it is written in the prophets  behold  i send my messenger before thy face  which shall prepare thy way before thee  
3	the voice of one crying in the wilderness  prepare ye the way of the lord  make his paths straight  
4	john did baptize in the wilderness  and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins  
5	and there went out unto him all the land of judaea  and they of jerusalem  and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan  confessing their sins  
6	and john was clothed with camel s hair  and with a girdle of a skin about his loins  and he did eat locusts and wild honey  
7	and preached  saying  there cometh one mightier than i after me  the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose  
8	i indeed have baptized you with water  but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost  
9 	and it came to pass in those days  that jesus came from nazareth of galilee  and was baptized of john in jordan  
10	and straightway coming up out of the water  he saw the heavens opened  and the spirit like a dove descending upon him  
11	and there came a voice from heaven   saying   thou art my beloved son  in whom i am well pleased  
12	and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness  
13	and he was there in the wilderness forty days  tempted of satan  and was with the wild beasts  and the angels ministered unto him  
14 	now after that john was put in prison  jesus came into galilee  preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god  
15	and saying  the time is fulfilled  and the kingdom of god is at hand  repent ye  and believe the gospel  
16	now as he walked by the sea of galilee  he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea  for they were fishers  
17	and jesus said unto them  come ye after me  and i will make you to become fishers of men  
18	and straightway they forsook their nets  and followed him  
19	and when he had gone a little further thence  he saw james the  son  of zebedee  and john his brother  who also were in the ship mending their nets  
20	and straightway he called them  and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants  and went after him  
21	and they went into capernaum  and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue  and taught  
22	and they were astonished at his doctrine  for he taught them as one that had authority  and not as the scribes  
23 	and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit  and he cried out  
24	saying  let  us  alone  what have we to do with thee  thou jesus of nazareth  art thou come to destroy us  i know thee who thou art  the holy one of god  
25	and jesus rebuked him  saying  hold thy peace  and come out of him  
26	and when the unclean spirit had torn him  and cried with a loud voice  he came out of him  
27	and they were all amazed  insomuch that they questioned among themselves  saying  what thing is this  what new doctrine  is  this  for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits  and they do obey him  
28	and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee  
29 	and forthwith  when they were come out of the synagogue  they entered into the house of simon and andrew  with james and john  
30	but simon s wife s mother lay sick of a fever  and anon they tell him of her  
31	and he came and took her by the hand  and lifted her up  and immediately the fever left her  and she ministered unto them  
32	and at even  when the sun did set  they brought unto him all that were diseased  and them that were possessed with devils  
33	and all the city was gathered together at the door  
34	and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases  and cast out many devils  and suffered not the devils to speak  because they knew him  
35	and in the morning  rising up a great while before day  he went out  and departed into a solitary place  and there prayed  
36	and simon and they that were with him followed after him  
37	and when they had found him  they said unto him  all  men  seek for thee  
38	and he said unto them  let us go into the next towns  that i may preach there also  for therefore came i forth  
39	and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee  and cast out devils  
40 	and there came a leper to him  beseeching him  and kneeling down to him  and saying unto him  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  
41	and jesus  moved with compassion  put forth  his  hand  and touched him  and saith unto him  i will  be thou clean  
42	and as soon as he had spoken  immediately the leprosy departed from him  and he was cleansed  
43	and he straitly charged him  and forthwith sent him away  
44	and saith unto him  see thou say nothing to any man  but go thy way  shew thyself to the priest  and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded  for a testimony unto them  
45	but he went out  and began to publish  it  much  and to blaze abroad the matter  insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city  but was without in desert places  and they came to him from every quarter  
mark 2
1 	and again he entered into capernaum after  some  days  and it was noised that he was in the house  
2	and straightway many were gathered together  insomuch that there was no room to receive  them   no  not so much as about the door  and he preached the word unto them  
3	and they come unto him  bringing one sick of the palsy  which was borne of four  
4	and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press  they uncovered the roof where he was  and when they had broken  it  up  they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay  
5	when jesus saw their faith  he said unto the sick of the palsy  son  thy sins be forgiven thee  
6	but there were certain of the scribes sitting there  and reasoning in their hearts  
7	why doth this  man  thus speak blasphemies  who can forgive sins but god only  
8	and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves  he said unto them  why reason ye these things in your hearts  
9	whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy   thy  sins be forgiven thee  or to say  arise  and take up thy bed  and walk  
10	but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins   he saith to the sick of the palsy   
11	i say unto thee  arise  and take up thy bed  and go thy way into thine house  
12	and immediately he arose  took up the bed  and went forth before them all  insomuch that they were all amazed  and glorified god  saying  we never saw it on this fashion  
13 	and he went forth again by the sea side  and all the multitude resorted unto him  and he taught them  
14	and as he passed by  he saw levi the  son  of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom  and said unto him  follow me  and he arose and followed him  
15	and it came to pass  that  as jesus sat at meat in his house  many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples  for there were many  and they followed him  
16	and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners  they said unto his disciples  how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners  
17	when jesus heard  it   he saith unto them  they that are whole have no need of the physician  but they that are sick  i came not to call the righteous  but sinners to repentance  
18 	and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast  and they come and say unto him  why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast  but thy disciples fast not  
19	and jesus said unto them  can the children of the bridechamber fast  while the bridegroom is with them  as long as they have the bridegroom with them  they cannot fast  
20	but the days will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them  and then shall they fast in those days  
21	no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment  else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old  and the rent is made worse  
22	and no man putteth new wine into old bottles  else the new wine doth burst the bottles  and the wine is spilled  and the bottles will be marred  but new wine must be put into new bottles  
23	and it came to pass  that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day  and his disciples began  as they went  to pluck the ears of corn  
24	and the pharisees said unto him  behold  why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful  
25	and he said unto them  have ye never read what david did  when he had need  and was an hungred  he  and they that were with him  
26	how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest  and did eat the shewbread  which is not lawful to eat but for the priests  and gave also to them which were with him  
27	and he said unto them  the sabbath was made for man  and not man for the sabbath  
28	therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath  
mark 3
1 	and he entered again into the synagogue  and there was a man there which had a withered hand  
2	and they watched him  whether he would heal him on the sabbath day  that they might accuse him  
3	and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand  stand forth  
4	and he saith unto them  is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days  or to do evil  to save life  or to kill  but they held their peace  
5	and when he had looked round about on them with anger  being grieved for the hardness of their hearts  he saith unto the man  stretch forth thine hand  and he stretched  it  out  and his hand was restored whole as the other  
6	and the pharisees went forth  and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him  how they might destroy him  
7	but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea  and a great multitude from galilee followed him  and from judaea  
8	and from jerusalem  and from idumaea  and  from  beyond jordan  and they about tyre and sidon  a great multitude  when they had heard what great things he did  came unto him  
9	and he spake to his disciples  that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude  lest they should throng him  
10	for he had healed many  insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him  as many as had plagues  
11	and unclean spirits  when they saw him  fell down before him  and cried  saying  thou art the son of god  
12	and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known  
13 	and he goeth up into a mountain  and calleth  unto him  whom he would  and they came unto him  
14	and he ordained twelve  that they should be with him  and that he might send them forth to preach  
15	and to have power to heal sicknesses  and to cast out devils  
16	and simon he surnamed peter  
17	and james the  son  of zebedee  and john the brother of james  and he surnamed them boanerges  which is  the sons of thunder  
18	and andrew  and philip  and bartholomew  and matthew  and thomas  and james the  son  of alphaeus  and thaddaeus  and simon the canaanite  
19	and judas iscariot  which also betrayed him  and they went into an house  
20	and the multitude cometh together again  so that they could not so much as eat bread  
21	and when his friends heard  of it   they went out to lay hold on him  for they said  he is beside himself  
22 	and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said  he hath beelzebub  and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils  
23	and he called them  unto him   and said unto them in parables  how can satan cast out satan  
24	and if a kingdom be divided against itself  that kingdom cannot stand  
25	and if a house be divided against itself  that house cannot stand  
26	and if satan rise up against himself  and be divided  he cannot stand  but hath an end  
27	no man can enter into a strong man s house  and spoil his goods  except he will first bind the strong man  and then he will spoil his house  
28	verily i say unto you  all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men  and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme  
29	but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness  but is in danger of eternal damnation  
30	because they said  he hath an unclean spirit  
31 	there came then his brethren and his mother  and  standing without  sent unto him  calling him  
32	and the multitude sat about him  and they said unto him  behold  thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee  
33	and he answered them  saying  who is my mother  or my brethren  
34	and he looked round about on them which sat about him  and said  behold my mother and my brethren  
35	for whosoever shall do the will of god  the same is my brother  and my sister  and mother  
mark 4
1 	and he began again to teach by the sea side  and there was gathered unto him a great multitude  so that he entered into a ship  and sat in the sea  and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land  
2	and he taught them many things by parables  and said unto them in his doctrine  
3	hearken  behold  there went out a sower to sow  
4	and it came to pass  as he sowed  some fell by the way side  and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up  
5	and some fell on stony ground  where it had not much earth  and immediately it sprang up  because it had no depth of earth  
6	but when the sun was up  it was scorched  and because it had no root  it withered away  
7	and some fell among thorns  and the thorns grew up  and choked it  and it yielded no fruit  
8	and other fell on good ground  and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased  and brought forth  some thirty  and some sixty  and some an hundred  
9	and he said unto them  he that hath ears to hear  let him hear  
10	and when he was alone  they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable  
11	and he said unto them  unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god  but unto them that are without  all  these  things are done in parables  
12	that seeing they may see  and not perceive  and hearing they may hear  and not understand  lest at any time they should be converted  and  their  sins should be forgiven them  
13	and he said unto them  know ye not this parable  and how then will ye know all parables  
14	the sower soweth the word  
15	and these are they by the way side  where the word is sown  but when they have heard  satan cometh immediately  and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts  
16	and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground  who  when they have heard the word  immediately receive it with gladness  
17	and have no root in themselves  and so endure but for a time  afterward  when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word s sake  immediately they are offended  
18	and these are they which are sown among thorns  such as hear the word  
19	and the cares of this world  and the deceitfulness of riches  and the lusts of other things entering in  choke the word  and it becometh unfruitful  
20	and these are they which are sown on good ground  such as hear the word  and receive  it   and bring forth fruit  some thirtyfold  some sixty  and some an hundred  
21 	and he said unto them  is a candle brought to be put under a bushel  or under a bed  and not to be set on a candlestick  
22	for there is nothing hid  which shall not be manifested  neither was any thing kept secret  but that it should come abroad  
23	if any man have ears to hear  let him hear  
24	and he said unto them  take heed what ye hear  with what measure ye mete  it shall be measured to you  and unto you that hear shall more be given  
25	for he that hath  to him shall be given  and he that hath not  from him shall be taken even that which he hath  
26	and he said  so is the kingdom of god  as if a man should cast seed into the ground  
27	and should sleep  and rise night and day  and the seed should spring and grow up  he knoweth not how  
28	for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself  first the blade  then the ear  after that the full corn in the ear  
29	but when the fruit is brought forth  immediately he putteth in the sickle  because the harvest is come  
30	and he said  whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god  or with what comparison shall we compare it  
31	 it is  like a grain of mustard seed  which  when it is sown in the earth  is less than all the seeds that be in the earth  
32	but when it is sown  it groweth up  and becometh greater than all herbs  and shooteth out great branches  so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it  
33	and with many such parables spake he the word unto them  as they were able to hear  it   
34	but without a parable spake he not unto them  and when they were alone  he expounded all things to his disciples  
35 	and the same day  when the even was come  he saith unto them  let us pass over unto the other side  
36	and when they had sent away the multitude  they took him even as he was in the ship  and there were also with him other little ships  
37	and there arose a great storm of wind  and the waves beat into the ship  so that it was now full  
38	and he was in the hinder part of the ship  asleep on a pillow  and they awake him  and say unto him  master  carest thou not that we perish  
39	and he arose  and rebuked the wind  and said unto the sea  peace  be still  and the wind ceased  and there was a great calm  
40	and he said unto them  why are ye so fearful  how is it that ye have no faith  
41	and they feared exceedingly  and said one to another  what manner of man is this  that even the wind and the sea obey him  
mark 5
1 	and they came over unto the other side of the sea  into the country of the gadarenes  
2	and when he was come out of the ship  immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit  
3	who had  his  dwelling among the tombs  and no man could bind him  no  not with chains  
4	because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains  and the chains had been plucked asunder by him  and the fetters broken in pieces  neither could any  man  tame him  
5	and always  night and day  he was in the mountains  and in the tombs  crying  and cutting himself with stones  
6	but when he saw jesus afar off  he ran and worshipped him  
7	and cried with a loud voice  and said  what have i to do with thee  jesus   thou  son of the most high god  i adjure thee by god  that thou torment me not  
8	for he said unto him  come out of the man   thou  unclean spirit  
9	and he asked him  what  is  thy name  and he answered  saying  my name  is  legion  for we are many  
10	and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country  
11	now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding  
12	and all the devils besought him  saying  send us into the swine  that we may enter into them  
13	and forthwith jesus gave them leave  and the unclean spirits went out  and entered into the swine  and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea   they were about two thousand   and were choked in the sea  
14	and they that fed the swine fled  and told  it  in the city  and in the country  and they went out to see what it was that was done  
15	and they come to jesus  and see him that was possessed with the devil  and had the legion  sitting  and clothed  and in his right mind  and they were afraid  
16	and they that saw  it  told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil  and  also  concerning the swine  
17	and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts  
18	and when he was come into the ship  he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him  
19	howbeit jesus suffered him not  but saith unto him  go home to thy friends  and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee  and hath had compassion on thee  
20	and he departed  and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him  and all  men  did marvel  
21 	and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side  much people gathered unto him  and he was nigh unto the sea  
22	and  behold  there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue  jairus by name  and when he saw him  he fell at his feet  
23	and besought him greatly  saying  my little daughter lieth at the point of death   i pray thee   come and lay thy hands on her  that she may be healed  and she shall live  
24	and  jesus  went with him  and much people followed him  and thronged him  
25	and a certain woman  which had an issue of blood twelve years  
26	and had suffered many things of many physicians  and had spent all that she had  and was nothing bettered  but rather grew worse  
27	when she had heard of jesus  came in the press behind  and touched his garment  
28	for she said  if i may touch but his clothes  i shall be whole  
29	and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up  and she felt in  her  body that she was healed of that plague  
30	and jesus  immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him  turned him about in the press  and said  who touched my clothes  
31	and his disciples said unto him  thou seest the multitude thronging thee  and sayest thou  who touched me  
32	and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing  
33	but the woman fearing and trembling  knowing what was done in her  came and fell down before him  and told him all the truth  
34	and he said unto her  daughter  thy faith hath made thee whole  go in peace  and be whole of thy plague  
35 	while he yet spake  there came from the ruler of the synagogue s  house certain  which said  thy daughter is dead  why troublest thou the master any further  
36	as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken  he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue  be not afraid  only believe  
37	and he suffered no man to follow him  save peter  and james  and john the brother of james  
38	and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue  and seeth the tumult  and them that wept and wailed greatly  
39	and when he was come in  he saith unto them  why make ye this ado  and weep  the damsel is not dead  but sleepeth  
40	and they laughed him to scorn  but when he had put them all out  he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel  and them that were with him  and entereth in where the damsel was lying  
41	and he took the damsel by the hand  and said unto her  talitha cumi  which is  being interpreted  damsel  i say unto thee  arise  
42	and straightway the damsel arose  and walked  for she was  of the age  of twelve years  and they were astonished with a great astonishment  
43	and he charged them straitly that no man should know it  and commanded that something should be given her to eat  
mark 6
1 	and he went out from thence  and came into his own country  and his disciples follow him  
2	and when the sabbath day was come  he began to teach in the synagogue  and many hearing  him  were astonished  saying  from whence hath this  man  these things  and what wisdom  is  this which is given unto him  that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands  
3	is not this the carpenter  the son of mary  the brother of james  and joses  and of juda  and simon  and are not his sisters here with us  and they were offended at him  
4	but jesus said unto them  a prophet is not without honour  but in his own country  and among his own kin  and in his own house  
5	and he could there do no mighty work  save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk  and healed  them   
6	and he marvelled because of their unbelief  and he went round about the villages  teaching  
7 	and he called  unto him  the twelve  and began to send them forth by two and two  and gave them power over unclean spirits  
8	and commanded them that they should take nothing for  their  journey  save a staff only  no scrip  no bread  no money in  their  purse  
9	but  be  shod with sandals  and not put on two coats  
10	and he said unto them  in what place soever ye enter into an house  there abide till ye depart from that place  
11	and whosoever shall not receive you  nor hear you  when ye depart thence  shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them  verily i say unto you  it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment  than for that city  
12	and they went out  and preached that men should repent  
13	and they cast out many devils  and anointed with oil many that were sick  and healed  them   
14 	and king herod heard  of him    for his name was spread abroad   and he said  that john the baptist was risen from the dead  and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him  
15	others said  that it is elias  and others said  that it is a prophet  or as one of the prophets  
16	but when herod heard  thereof   he said  it is john  whom i beheaded  he is risen from the dead  
17	for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john  and bound him in prison for herodias  sake  his brother philip s wife  for he had married her  
18	for john had said unto herod  it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother s wife  
19	therefore herodias had a quarrel against him  and would have killed him  but she could not  
20	for herod feared john  knowing that he was a just man and an holy  and observed him  and when he heard him  he did many things  and heard him gladly  
21	and when a convenient day was come  that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords  high captains  and chief  estates  of galilee  
22	and when the daughter of the said herodias came in  and danced  and pleased herod and them that sat with him  the king said unto the damsel  ask of me whatsoever thou wilt  and i will give  it  thee  
23	and he sware unto her  whatsoever thou shalt ask of me  i will give  it  thee  unto the half of my kingdom  
24	and she went forth  and said unto her mother  what shall i ask  and she said  the head of john the baptist  
25	and she came in straightway with haste unto the king  and asked  saying  i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist  
26	and the king was exceeding sorry   yet  for his oath s sake  and for their sakes which sat with him  he would not reject her  
27	and immediately the king sent an executioner  and commanded his head to be brought  and he went and beheaded him in the prison  
28	and brought his head in a charger  and gave it to the damsel  and the damsel gave it to her mother  
29	and when his disciples heard  of it   they came and took up his corpse  and laid it in a tomb  
30 	and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus  and told him all things  both what they had done  and what they had taught  
31	and he said unto them  come ye yourselves apart into a desert place  and rest a while  for there were many coming and going  and they had no leisure so much as to eat  
32	and they departed into a desert place by ship privately  
33	and the people saw them departing  and many knew him  and ran afoot thither out of all cities  and outwent them  and came together unto him  
34	and jesus  when he came out  saw much people  and was moved with compassion toward them  because they were as sheep not having a shepherd  and he began to teach them many things  
35	and when the day was now far spent  his disciples came unto him  and said  this is a desert place  and now the time  is  far passed  
36	send them away  that they may go into the country round about  and into the villages  and buy themselves bread  for they have nothing to eat  
37	he answered and said unto them  give ye them to eat  and they say unto him  shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread  and give them to eat  
38	he saith unto them  how many loaves have ye  go and see  and when they knew  they say  five  and two fishes  
39	and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass  
40	and they sat down in ranks  by hundreds  and by fifties  
41	and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes  he looked up to heaven  and blessed  and brake the loaves  and gave  them  to his disciples to set before them  and the two fishes divided he among them all  
42	and they did all eat  and were filled  
43	and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments  and of the fishes  
44	and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men  
45 	and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship  and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida  while he sent away the people  
46	and when he had sent them away  he departed into a mountain to pray  
47	and when even was come  the ship was in the midst of the sea  and he alone on the land  
48	and he saw them toiling in rowing  for the wind was contrary unto them  and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them  walking upon the sea  and would have passed by them  
49	but when they saw him walking upon the sea  they supposed it had been a spirit  and cried out  
50	for they all saw him  and were troubled  and immediately he talked with them  and saith unto them  be of good cheer  it is i  be not afraid  
51	and he went up unto them into the ship  and the wind ceased  and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure  and wondered  
52	for they considered not  the miracle  of the loaves  for their heart was hardened  
53	and when they had passed over  they came into the land of gennesaret  and drew to the shore  
54	and when they were come out of the ship  straightway they knew him  
55	and ran through that whole region round about  and began to carry about in beds those that were sick  where they heard he was  
56	and whithersoever he entered  into villages  or cities  or country  they laid the sick in the streets  and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment  and as many as touched him were made whole  
mark 7
1 	then came together unto him the pharisees  and certain of the scribes  which came from jerusalem  
2	and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled  that is to say  with unwashen  hands  they found fault  
3	for the pharisees  and all the jews  except they wash  their  hands oft  eat not  holding the tradition of the elders  
4	and  when they come  from the market  except they wash  they eat not  and many other things there be  which they have received to hold   as  the washing of cups  and pots  brasen vessels  and of tables  
5	then the pharisees and scribes asked him  why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders  but eat bread with unwashen hands  
6	he answered and said unto them  well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites  as it is written  this people honoureth me with  their  lips  but their heart is far from me  
7	howbeit in vain do they worship me  teaching  for  doctrines the commandments of men  
8	for laying aside the commandment of god  ye hold the tradition of men   as  the washing of pots and cups  and many other such like things ye do  
9	and he said unto them  full well ye reject the commandment of god  that ye may keep your own tradition  
10	for moses said  honour thy father and thy mother  and  whoso curseth father or mother  let him die the death  
11	but ye say  if a man shall say to his father or mother   it is  corban  that is to say  a gift  by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me   he shall be free   
12	and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother  
13	making the word of god of none effect through your tradition  which ye have delivered  and many such like things do ye  
14	and when he had called all the people  unto him   he said unto them  hearken unto me every one  of you   and understand  
15	there is nothing from without a man  that entering into him can defile him  but the things which come out of him  those are they that defile the man  
16	if any man have ears to hear  let him hear  
17	and when he was entered into the house from the people  his disciples asked him concerning the parable  
18	and he saith unto them  are ye so without understanding also  do ye not perceive  that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man   it  cannot defile him  
19	because it entereth not into his heart  but into the belly  and goeth out into the draught  purging all meats  
20	and he said  that which cometh out of the man  that defileth the man  
21	for from within  out of the heart of men  proceed evil thoughts  adulteries  fornications  murders  
22	thefts  covetousness  wickedness  deceit  lasciviousness  an evil eye  blasphemy  pride  foolishness  
23	all these evil things come from within  and defile the man  
24 	and from thence he arose  and went into the borders of tyre and sidon  and entered into an house  and would have no man know  it   but he could not be hid  
25	for a  certain  woman  whose young daughter had an unclean spirit  heard of him  and came and fell at his feet  
26	the woman was a greek  a syrophenician by nation  and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter  
27	but jesus said unto her  let the children first be filled  for it is not meet to take the children s bread  and to cast  it  unto the dogs  
28	and she answered and said unto him  yes  lord  yet the dogs under the table eat of the children s crumbs  
29	and he said unto her  for this saying go thy way  the devil is gone out of thy daughter  
30	and when she was come to her house  she found the devil gone out  and her daughter laid upon the bed  
31 	and again  departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon  he came unto the sea of galilee  through the midst of the coasts of decapolis  
32	and they bring unto him one that was deaf  and had an impediment in his speech  and they beseech him to put his hand upon him  
33	and he took him aside from the multitude  and put his fingers into his ears  and he spit  and touched his tongue  
34	and looking up to heaven  he sighed  and saith unto him  ephphatha  that is  be opened  
35	and straightway his ears were opened  and the string of his tongue was loosed  and he spake plain  
36	and he charged them that they should tell no man  but the more he charged them  so much the more a great deal they published  it   
37	and were beyond measure astonished  saying  he hath done all things well  he maketh both the deaf to hear  and the dumb to speak  
mark 8
1 	in those days the multitude being very great  and having nothing to eat  jesus called his disciples  unto him   and saith unto them  
2	i have compassion on the multitude  because they have now been with me three days  and have nothing to eat  
3	and if i send them away fasting to their own houses  they will faint by the way  for divers of them came from far  
4	and his disciples answered him  from whence can a man satisfy these  men  with bread here in the wilderness  
5	and he asked them  how many loaves have ye  and they said  seven  
6	and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground  and he took the seven loaves  and gave thanks  and brake  and gave to his disciples to set before  them   and they did set  them  before the people  
7	and they had a few small fishes  and he blessed  and commanded to set them also before  them   
8	so they did eat  and were filled  and they took up of the broken  meat  that was left seven baskets  
9	and they that had eaten were about four thousand  and he sent them away  
10 	and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples  and came into the parts of dalmanutha  
11	and the pharisees came forth  and began to question with him  seeking of him a sign from heaven  tempting him  
12	and he sighed deeply in his spirit  and saith  why doth this generation seek after a sign  verily i say unto you  there shall no sign be given unto this generation  
13	and he left them  and entering into the ship again departed to the other side  
14	now  the disciples  had forgotten to take bread  neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf  
15	and he charged them  saying  take heed  beware of the leaven of the pharisees  and  of  the leaven of herod  
16	and they reasoned among themselves  saying   it is  because we have no bread  
17	and when jesus knew  it   he saith unto them  why reason ye  because ye have no bread  perceive ye not yet  neither understand  have ye your heart yet hardened  
18	having eyes  see ye not  and having ears  hear ye not  and do ye not remember  
19	when i brake the five loaves among five thousand  how many baskets full of fragments took ye up  they say unto him  twelve  
20	and when the seven among four thousand  how many baskets full of fragments took ye up  and they said  seven  
21	and he said unto them  how is it that ye do not understand  
22 	and he cometh to bethsaida  and they bring a blind man unto him  and besought him to touch him  
23	and he took the blind man by the hand  and led him out of the town  and when he had spit on his eyes  and put his hands upon him  he asked him if he saw ought  
24	and he looked up  and said  i see men as trees  walking  
25	after that he put  his  hands again upon his eyes  and made him look up  and he was restored  and saw every man clearly  
26	and he sent him away to his house  saying  neither go into the town  nor tell  it  to any in the town  
27 	and jesus went out  and his disciples  into the towns of caesarea philippi  and by the way he asked his disciples  saying unto them  whom do men say that i am  
28	and they answered  john the baptist  but some  say   elias  and others  one of the prophets  
29	and he saith unto them  but whom say ye that i am  and peter answereth and saith unto him  thou art the christ  
30	and he charged them that they should tell no man of him  
31	and he began to teach them  that the son of man must suffer many things  and be rejected of the elders  and  of  the chief priests  and scribes  and be killed  and after three days rise again  
32	and he spake that saying openly  and peter took him  and began to rebuke him  
33	but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples  he rebuked peter  saying  get thee behind me  satan  for thou savourest not the things that be of god  but the things that be of men  
34	and when he had called the people  unto him  with his disciples also  he said unto them  whosoever will come after me  let him deny himself  and take up his cross  and follow me  
35	for whosoever will save his life shall lose it  but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel s  the same shall save it  
36	for what shall it profit a man  if he shall gain the whole world  and lose his own soul  
37	or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul  
38	whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation  of him also shall the son of man be ashamed  when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels  
mark 9
1 	and he said unto them  verily i say unto you  that there be some of them that stand here  which shall not taste of death  till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power  
2	and after six days jesus taketh  with him  peter  and james  and john  and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves  and he was transfigured before them  
3	and his raiment became shining  exceeding white as snow  so as no fuller on earth can white them  
4	and there appeared unto them elias with moses  and they were talking with jesus  
5	and peter answered and said to jesus  master  it is good for us to be here  and let us make three tabernacles  one for thee  and one for moses  and one for elias  
6	for he wist not what to say  for they were sore afraid  
7	and there was a cloud that overshadowed them  and a voice came out of the cloud  saying  this is my beloved son  hear him  
8	and suddenly  when they had looked round about  they saw no man any more  save jesus only with themselves  
9	and as they came down from the mountain  he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen  till the son of man were risen from the dead  
10	and they kept that saying with themselves  questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean  
11	and they asked him  saying  why say the scribes that elias must first come  
12	and he answered and told them  elias verily cometh first  and restoreth all things  and how it is written of the son of man  that he must suffer many things  and be set at nought  
13	but i say unto you  that elias is indeed come  and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed  as it is written of him  
14 	and when he came to  his  disciples  he saw a great multitude about them  and the scribes questioning with them  
15	and straightway all the people  when they beheld him  were greatly amazed  and running to  him  saluted him  
16	and he asked the scribes  what question ye with them  
17	and one of the multitude answered and said  master  i have brought unto thee my son  which hath a dumb spirit  
18	and wheresoever he taketh him  he teareth him  and he foameth  and gnasheth with his teeth  and pineth away  and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out  and they could not  
19	he answereth him  and saith  o faithless generation  how long shall i be with you  how long shall i suffer you  bring him unto me  
20	and they brought him unto him  and when he saw him  straightway the spirit tare him  and he fell on the ground  and wallowed foaming  
21	and he asked his father  how long is it ago since this came unto him  and he said  of a child  
22	and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire  and into the waters  to destroy him  but if thou canst do any thing  have compassion on us  and help us  
23	jesus said unto him  if thou canst believe  all things  are  possible to him that believeth  
24	and straightway the father of the child cried out  and said with tears  lord  i believe  help thou mine unbelief  
25	when jesus saw that the people came running together  he rebuked the foul spirit  saying unto him   thou  dumb and deaf spirit  i charge thee  come out of him  and enter no more into him  
26	and  the spirit  cried  and rent him sore  and came out of him  and he was as one dead  insomuch that many said  he is dead  
27	but jesus took him by the hand  and lifted him up  and he arose  
28	and when he was come into the house  his disciples asked him privately  why could not we cast him out  
29	and he said unto them  this kind can come forth by nothing  but by prayer and fasting  
30 	and they departed thence  and passed through galilee  and he would not that any man should know  it   
31	for he taught his disciples  and said unto them  the son of man is delivered into the hands of men  and they shall kill him  and after that he is killed  he shall rise the third day  
32	but they understood not that saying  and were afraid to ask him  
33	and he came to capernaum  and being in the house he asked them  what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way  
34	but they held their peace  for by the way they had disputed among themselves  who  should be  the greatest  
35	and he sat down  and called the twelve  and saith unto them  if any man desire to be first   the same  shall be last of all  and servant of all  
36	and he took a child  and set him in the midst of them  and when he had taken him in his arms  he said unto them  
37	whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name  receiveth me  and whosoever shall receive me  receiveth not me  but him that sent me  
38	and john answered him  saying  master  we saw one casting out devils in thy name  and he followeth not us  and we forbad him  because he followeth not us  
39	but jesus said  forbid him not  for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name  that can lightly speak evil of me  
40	for he that is not against us is on our part  
41 	for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name  because ye belong to christ  verily i say unto you  he shall not lose his reward  
42	and whosoever shall offend one of  these  little ones that believe in me  it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and he were cast into the sea  
43	and if thy hand offend thee  cut it off  it is better for thee to enter into life maimed  than having two hands to go into hell  into the fire that never shall be quenched  
44	where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quenched  
45	and if thy foot offend thee  cut it off  it is better for thee to enter halt into life  than having two feet to be cast into hell  into the fire that never shall be quenched  
46	where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quenched  
47	and if thine eye offend thee  pluck it out  it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye  than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire  
48	where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quenched  
49	for every one shall be salted with fire  and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt  
50	salt  is  good  but if the salt have lost his saltness  wherewith will ye season it  have salt in yourselves  and have peace one with another  
mark 10
1 	and he arose from thence  and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan  and the people resort unto him again  and  as he was wont  he taught them again  
2	and the pharisees came to him  and asked him  is it lawful for a man to put away  his  wife  tempting him  
3	and he answered and said unto them  what did moses command you  
4	and they said  moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement  and to put  her  away  
5	and jesus answered and said unto them  for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept  
6	but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female  
7	for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother  and cleave to his wife  
8	and they twain shall be one flesh  so then they are no more twain  but one flesh  
9	what therefore god hath joined together  let not man put asunder  
10	and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same  matter   
11	and he saith unto them  whosoever shall put away his wife  and marry another  committeth adultery against her  
12	and if a woman shall put away her husband  and be married to another  she committeth adultery  
13 	and they brought young children to him  that he should touch them  and  his  disciples rebuked those that brought  them   
14	but when jesus saw  it   he was much displeased  and said unto them  suffer the little children to come unto me  and forbid them not  for of such is the kingdom of god  
15	verily i say unto you  whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child  he shall not enter therein  
16	and he took them up in his arms  put  his  hands upon them  and blessed them  
17 	and when he was gone forth into the way  there came one running  and kneeled to him  and asked him  good master  what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life  
18	and jesus said unto him  why callest thou me good   there is  none good but one   that is   god  
19	thou knowest the commandments  do not commit adultery  do not kill  do not steal  do not bear false witness  defraud not  honour thy father and mother  
20	and he answered and said unto him  master  all these have i observed from my youth  
21	then jesus beholding him loved him  and said unto him  one thing thou lackest  go thy way  sell whatsoever thou hast  and give to the poor  and thou shalt have treasure in heaven  and come  take up the cross  and follow me  
22	and he was sad at that saying  and went away grieved  for he had great possessions  
23	and jesus looked round about  and saith unto his disciples  how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god  
24	and the disciples were astonished at his words  but jesus answereth again  and saith unto them  children  how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god  
25	it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  
26	and they were astonished out of measure  saying among themselves  who then can be saved  
27	and jesus looking upon them saith  with men  it is  impossible  but not with god  for with god all things are possible  
28	then peter began to say unto him  lo  we have left all  and have followed thee  
29	and jesus answered and said  verily i say unto you  there is no man that hath left house  or brethren  or sisters  or father  or mother  or wife  or children  or lands  for my sake  and the gospel s  
30	but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time  houses  and brethren  and sisters  and mothers  and children  and lands  with persecutions  and in the world to come eternal life  
31	but many  that are  first shall be last  and the last first  
32 	and they were in the way going up to jerusalem  and jesus went before them  and they were amazed  and as they followed  they were afraid  and he took again the twelve  and began to tell them what things should happen unto him  
33	 saying   behold  we go up to jerusalem  and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests  and unto the scribes  and they shall condemn him to death  and shall deliver him to the gentiles  
34	and they shall mock him  and shall scourge him  and shall spit upon him  and shall kill him  and the third day he shall rise again  
35	and james and john  the sons of zebedee  come unto him  saying  master  we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire  
36	and he said unto them  what would ye that i should do for you  
37	they said unto him  grant unto us that we may sit  one on thy right hand  and the other on thy left hand  in thy glory  
38	but jesus said unto them  ye know not what ye ask  can ye drink of the cup that i drink of  and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with  
39	and they said unto him  we can  and jesus said unto them  ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of  and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized  
40	but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give  but  it shall be given to them  for whom it is prepared  
41	and when the ten heard  it   they began to be much displeased with james and john  
42	but jesus called them  to him   and saith unto them  ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them  and their great ones exercise authority upon them  
43	but so shall it not be among you  but whosoever will be great among you  shall be your minister  
44	and whosoever of you will be the chiefest  shall be servant of all  
45	for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto  but to minister  and to give his life a ransom for many  
46 	and they came to jericho  and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people  blind bartimaeus  the son of timaeus  sat by the highway side begging  
47	and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth  he began to cry out  and say  jesus   thou  son of david  have mercy on me  
48	and many charged him that he should hold his peace  but he cried the more a great deal   thou  son of david  have mercy on me  
49	and jesus stood still  and commanded him to be called  and they call the blind man  saying unto him  be of good comfort  rise  he calleth thee  
50	and he  casting away his garment  rose  and came to jesus  
51	and jesus answered and said unto him  what wilt thou that i should do unto thee  the blind man said unto him  lord  that i might receive my sight  
52	and jesus said unto him  go thy way  thy faith hath made thee whole  and immediately he received his sight  and followed jesus in the way  
mark 11
1 	and when they came nigh to jerusalem  unto bethphage and bethany  at the mount of olives  he sendeth forth two of his disciples  
2	and saith unto them  go your way into the village over against you  and as soon as ye be entered into it  ye shall find a colt tied  whereon never man sat  loose him  and bring  him   
3	and if any man say unto you  why do ye this  say ye that the lord hath need of him  and straightway he will send him hither  
4	and they went their way  and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met  and they loose him  
5	and certain of them that stood there said unto them  what do ye  loosing the colt  
6	and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded  and they let them go  
7	and they brought the colt to jesus  and cast their garments on him  and he sat upon him  
8	and many spread their garments in the way  and others cut down branches off the trees  and strawed  them  in the way  
9	and they that went before  and they that followed  cried  saying  hosanna  blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the lord  
10	blessed  be  the kingdom of our father david  that cometh in the name of the lord  hosanna in the highest  
11	and jesus entered into jerusalem  and into the temple  and when he had looked round about upon all things  and now the eventide was come  he went out unto bethany with the twelve  
12 	and on the morrow  when they were come from bethany  he was hungry  
13	and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves  he came  if haply he might find any thing thereon  and when he came to it  he found nothing but leaves  for the time of figs was not  yet   
14	and jesus answered and said unto it  no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever  and his disciples heard  it   
15	and they come to jerusalem  and jesus went into the temple  and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple  and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers  and the seats of them that sold doves  
16	and would not suffer that any man should carry  any  vessel through the temple  
17	and he taught  saying unto them  is it not written  my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thieves  
18	and the scribes and chief priests heard  it   and sought how they might destroy him  for they feared him  because all the people was astonished at his doctrine  
19	and when even was come  he went out of the city  
20	and in the morning  as they passed by  they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots  
21	and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him  master  behold  the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away  
22	and jesus answering saith unto them  have faith in god  
23	for verily i say unto you  that whosoever shall say unto this mountain  be thou removed  and be thou cast into the sea  and shall not doubt in his heart  but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass  he shall have whatsoever he saith  
24	therefore i say unto you  what things soever ye desire  when ye pray  believe that ye receive  them   and ye shall have  them   
25	and when ye stand praying  forgive  if ye have ought against any  that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses  
26	but if ye do not forgive  neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses  
27 	and they come again to jerusalem  and as he was walking in the temple  there come to him the chief priests  and the scribes  and the elders  
28	and say unto him  by what authority doest thou these things  and who gave thee this authority to do these things  
29	and jesus answered and said unto them  i will also ask of you one question  and answer me  and i will tell you by what authority i do these things  
30	the baptism of john  was  it  from heaven  or of men  answer me  
31	and they reasoned with themselves  saying  if we shall say  from heaven  he will say  why then did ye not believe him  
32	but if we shall say  of men  they feared the people  for all  men  counted john  that he was a prophet indeed  
33	and they answered and said unto jesus  we cannot tell  and jesus answering saith unto them  neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things  
mark 12
1 	and he began to speak unto them by parables  a  certain  man planted a vineyard  and set an hedge about  it   and digged  a place for  the winefat  and built a tower  and let it out to husbandmen  and went into a far country  
2	and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant  that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard  
3	and they caught  him   and beat him  and sent  him  away empty  
4	and again he sent unto them another servant  and at him they cast stones  and wounded  him  in the head  and sent  him  away shamefully handled  
5	and again he sent another  and him they killed  and many others  beating some  and killing some  
6	having yet therefore one son  his wellbeloved  he sent him also last unto them  saying  they will reverence my son  
7	but those husbandmen said among themselves  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  and the inheritance shall be ours  
8	and they took him  and killed  him   and cast  him  out of the vineyard  
9	what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do  he will come and destroy the husbandmen  and will give the vineyard unto others  
10	and have ye not read this scripture  the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner  
11	this was the lord s doing  and it is marvellous in our eyes  
12	and they sought to lay hold on him  but feared the people  for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them  and they left him  and went their way  
13 	and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians  to catch him in  his  words  
14	and when they were come  they say unto him  master  we know that thou art true  and carest for no man  for thou regardest not the person of men  but teachest the way of god in truth  is it lawful to give tribute to caesar  or not  
15	shall we give  or shall we not give  but he  knowing their hypocrisy  said unto them  why tempt ye me  bring me a penny  that i may see  it   
16	and they brought  it   and he saith unto them  whose  is  this image and superscription  and they said unto him  caesar s  
17	and jesus answering said unto them  render to caesar the things that are caesar s  and to god the things that are god s  and they marvelled at him  
18 	then come unto him the sadducees  which say there is no resurrection  and they asked him  saying  
19	master  moses wrote unto us  if a man s brother die  and leave  his  wife  behind him   and leave no children  that his brother should take his wife  and raise up seed unto his brother  
20	now there were seven brethren  and the first took a wife  and dying left no seed  
21	and the second took her  and died  neither left he any seed  and the third likewise  
22	and the seven had her  and left no seed  last of all the woman died also  
23	in the resurrection therefore  when they shall rise  whose wife shall she be of them  for the seven had her to wife  
24	and jesus answering said unto them  do ye not therefore err  because ye know not the scriptures  neither the power of god  
25	for when they shall rise from the dead  they neither marry  nor are given in marriage  but are as the angels which are in heaven  
26	and as touching the dead  that they rise  have ye not read in the book of moses  how in the bush god spake unto him  saying  i  am  the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  
27	he is not the god of the dead  but the god of the living  ye therefore do greatly err  
28 	and one of the scribes came  and having heard them reasoning together  and perceiving that he had answered them well  asked him  which is the first commandment of all  
29	and jesus answered him  the first of all the commandments  is   hear  o israel  the lord our god is one lord  
30	and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart  and with all thy soul  and with all thy mind  and with all thy strength  this  is  the first commandment  
31	and the second  is  like   namely  this  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  there is none other commandment greater than these  
32	and the scribe said unto him  well  master  thou hast said the truth  for there is one god  and there is none other but he  
33	and to love him with all the heart  and with all the understanding  and with all the soul  and with all the strength  and to love  his  neighbour as himself  is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices  
34	and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly  he said unto him  thou art not far from the kingdom of god  and no man after that durst ask him  any question   
35 	and jesus answered and said  while he taught in the temple  how say the scribes that christ is the son of david  
36	for david himself said by the holy ghost  the lord said to my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine enemies thy footstool  
37	david therefore himself calleth him lord  and whence is he  then  his son  and the common people heard him gladly  
38	and he said unto them in his doctrine  beware of the scribes  which love to go in long clothing  and  love  salutations in the marketplaces  
39	and the chief seats in the synagogues  and the uppermost rooms at feasts  
40	which devour widows  houses  and for a pretence make long prayers  these shall receive greater damnation  
41 	and jesus sat over against the treasury  and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury  and many that were rich cast in much  
42	and there came a certain poor widow  and she threw in two mites  which make a farthing  
43	and he called  unto him  his disciples  and saith unto them  verily i say unto you  that this poor widow hath cast more in  than all they which have cast into the treasury  
44	for all  they  did cast in of their abundance  but she of her want did cast in all that she had   even  all her living  
mark 13
1 	and as he went out of the temple  one of his disciples saith unto him  master  see what manner of stones and what buildings  are here   
2	and jesus answering said unto him  seest thou these great buildings  there shall not be left one stone upon another  that shall not be thrown down  
3	and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple  peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately  
4	tell us  when shall these things be  and what  shall be  the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled  
5 	and jesus answering them began to say  take heed lest any  man  deceive you  
6	for many shall come in my name  saying  i am  christ   and shall deceive many  
7	and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars  be ye not troubled  for  such things  must needs be  but the end  shall  not  be  yet  
8	for nation shall rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  and there shall be earthquakes in divers places  and there shall be famines and troubles  these  are  the beginnings of sorrows  
9	but take heed to yourselves  for they shall deliver you up to councils  and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten  and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake  for a testimony against them  
10	and the gospel must first be published among all nations  
11	but when they shall lead  you   and deliver you up  take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak  neither do ye premeditate  but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour  that speak ye  for it is not ye that speak  but the holy ghost  
12	now the brother shall betray the brother to death  and the father the son  and children shall rise up against  their  parents  and shall cause them to be put to death  
13	and ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name s sake  but he that shall endure unto the end  the same shall be saved  
14 	but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation  spoken of by daniel the prophet  standing where it ought not   let him that readeth understand   then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains  
15	and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house  neither enter  therein   to take any thing out of his house  
16	and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment  
17	but woe to them that are with child  and to them that give suck in those days  
18	and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter  
19	for  in  those days shall be affliction  such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time  neither shall be  
20	and except that the lord had shortened those days  no flesh should be saved  but for the elect s sake  whom he hath chosen  he hath shortened the days  
21	and then if any man shall say to you  lo  here  is  christ  or  lo   he is  there  believe  him  not  
22	for false christs and false prophets shall rise  and shall shew signs and wonders  to seduce  if  it were  possible  even the elect  
23	but take ye heed  behold  i have foretold you all things  
24 	but in those days  after that tribulation  the sun shall be darkened  and the moon shall not give her light  
25	and the stars of heaven shall fall  and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken  
26	and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory  
27	and then shall he send his angels  and shall gather together his elect from the four winds  from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven  
28 	now learn a parable of the fig tree  when her branch is yet tender  and putteth forth leaves  ye know that summer is near  
29	so ye in like manner  when ye shall see these things come to pass  know that it is nigh   even  at the doors  
30	verily i say unto you  that this generation shall not pass  till all these things be done  
31	heaven and earth shall pass away  but my words shall not pass away  
32	but of that day and  that  hour knoweth no man  no  not the angels which are in heaven  neither the son  but the father  
33	take ye heed  watch and pray  for ye know not when the time is  
34	 for the son of man is  as a man taking a far journey  who left his house  and gave authority to his servants  and to every man his work  and commanded the porter to watch  
35	watch ye therefore  for ye know not when the master of the house cometh  at even  or at midnight  or at the cockcrowing  or in the morning  
36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping  
37	and what i say unto you i say unto all  watch  
mark 14
1 	after two days was  the feast of  the passover  and of unleavened bread  and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft  and put  him  to death  
2	but they said  not on the feast  day   lest there be an uproar of the people  
3	and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper  as he sat at meat  there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious  and she brake the box  and poured  it  on his head  
4	and there were some that had indignation within themselves  and said  why was this waste of the ointment made  
5	for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence  and have been given to the poor  and they murmured against her  
6	and jesus said  let her alone  why trouble ye her  she hath wrought a good work on me  
7	for ye have the poor with you always  and whensoever ye will ye may do them good  but me ye have not always  
8	she hath done what she could  she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying  
9	verily i say unto you  wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world   this  also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her  
10	and judas iscariot  one of the twelve  went unto the chief priests  to betray him unto them  
11	and when they heard  it   they were glad  and promised to give him money  and he sought how he might conveniently betray him  
12 	and the first day of unleavened bread  when they killed the passover  his disciples said unto him  where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover  
13	and he sendeth forth two of his disciples  and saith unto them  go ye into the city  and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water  follow him  
14	and wheresoever he shall go in  say ye to the goodman of the house  the master saith  where is the guestchamber  where i shall eat the passover with my disciples  
15	and he will shew you a large upper room furnished  and  prepared  there make ready for us  
16	and his disciples went forth  and came into the city  and found as he had said unto them  and they made ready the passover  
17	and in the evening he cometh with the twelve  
18	and as they sat and did eat  jesus said  verily i say unto you  one of you which eateth with me shall betray me  
19	and they began to be sorrowful  and to say unto him one by one   is  it i  and another  said  is  it i  
20	and he answered and said unto them   it is  one of the twelve  that dippeth with me in the dish  
21	the son of man indeed goeth  as it is written of him  but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed  good were it for that man if he had never been born  
22	and as they did eat  jesus took bread  and blessed  and brake  it   and gave to them  and said  take  eat  this is my body  
23	and he took the cup  and when he had given thanks  he gave  it  to them  and they all drank of it  
24	and he said unto them  this is my blood of the new testament  which is shed for many  
25	verily i say unto you  i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine  until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god  
26	and when they had sung an hymn  they went out into the mount of olives  
27	and jesus saith unto them  all ye shall be offended because of me this night  for it is written  i will smite the shepherd  and the sheep shall be scattered  
28	but after that i am risen  i will go before you into galilee  
29	but peter said unto him  although all shall be offended  yet  will  not i  
30	and jesus saith unto him  verily i say unto thee  that this day   even  in this night  before the cock crow twice  thou shalt deny me thrice  
31	but he spake the more vehemently  if i should die with thee  i will not deny thee in any wise  likewise also said they all  
32 	and they came to a place which was named gethsemane  and he saith to his disciples  sit ye here  while i shall pray  
33	and he taketh with him peter and james and john  and began to be sore amazed  and to be very heavy  
34	and saith unto them  my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death  tarry ye here  and watch  
35	and he went forward a little  and fell on the ground  and prayed that  if it were possible  the hour might pass from him  
36	and he said  abba  father  all things  are  possible unto thee  take away this cup from me  nevertheless not what i will  but what thou wilt  
37	and he cometh  and findeth them sleeping  and saith unto peter  simon  sleepest thou  couldest not thou watch one hour  
38	watch ye and pray  lest ye enter into temptation  the spirit truly  is  ready  but the flesh  is  weak  
39	and again he went away  and prayed  and spake the same words  
40	and when he returned  he found them asleep again   for their eyes were heavy   neither wist they what to answer him  
41	and he cometh the third time  and saith unto them  sleep on now  and take  your  rest  it is enough  the hour is come  behold  the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners  
42	rise up  let us go  lo  he that betrayeth me is at hand  
43 	and immediately  while he yet spake  cometh judas  one of the twelve  and with him a great multitude with swords and staves  from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders  
44	and he that betrayed him had given them a token  saying  whomsoever i shall kiss  that same is he  take him  and lead  him  away safely  
45	and as soon as he was come  he goeth straightway to him  and saith  master  master  and kissed him  
46	and they laid their hands on him  and took him  
47	and one of them that stood by drew a sword  and smote a servant of the high priest  and cut off his ear  
48	and jesus answered and said unto them  are ye come out  as against a thief  with swords and  with  staves to take me  
49	i was daily with you in the temple teaching  and ye took me not  but the scriptures must be fulfilled  
50	and they all forsook him  and fled  
51	and there followed him a certain young man  having a linen cloth cast about  his  naked  body   and the young men laid hold on him  
52	and he left the linen cloth  and fled from them naked  
53 	and they led jesus away to the high priest  and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes  
54	and peter followed him afar off  even into the palace of the high priest  and he sat with the servants  and warmed himself at the fire  
55	and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death  and found none  
56	for many bare false witness against him  but their witness agreed not together  
57	and there arose certain  and bare false witness against him  saying  
58	we heard him say  i will destroy this temple that is made with hands  and within three days i will build another made without hands  
59	but neither so did their witness agree together  
60	and the high priest stood up in the midst  and asked jesus  saying  answerest thou nothing  what  is it which  these witness against thee  
61	but he held his peace  and answered nothing  again the high priest asked him  and said unto him  art thou the christ  the son of the blessed  
62	and jesus said  i am  and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power  and coming in the clouds of heaven  
63	then the high priest rent his clothes  and saith  what need we any further witnesses  
64	ye have heard the blasphemy  what think ye  and they all condemned him to be guilty of death  
65	and some began to spit on him  and to cover his face  and to buffet him  and to say unto him  prophesy  and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands  
66 	and as peter was beneath in the palace  there cometh one of the maids of the high priest  
67	and when she saw peter warming himself  she looked upon him  and said  and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth  
68	but he denied  saying  i know not  neither understand i what thou sayest  and he went out into the porch  and the cock crew  
69	and a maid saw him again  and began to say to them that stood by  this is  one  of them  
70	and he denied it again  and a little after  they that stood by said again to peter  surely thou art  one  of them  for thou art a galilaean  and thy speech agreeth  thereto   
71	but he began to curse and to swear   saying   i know not this man of whom ye speak  
72	and the second time the cock crew  and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him  before the cock crow twice  thou shalt deny me thrice  and when he thought thereon  he wept  
mark 15
1 	and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council  and bound jesus  and carried  him  away  and delivered  him  to pilate  
2	and pilate asked him  art thou the king of the jews  and he answering said unto him  thou sayest  it   
3	and the chief priests accused him of many things  but he answered nothing  
4	and pilate asked him again  saying  answerest thou nothing  behold how many things they witness against thee  
5	but jesus yet answered nothing  so that pilate marvelled  
6	now at  that  feast he released unto them one prisoner  whomsoever they desired  
7	and there was  one  named barabbas   which lay  bound with them that had made insurrection with him  who had committed murder in the insurrection  
8	and the multitude crying aloud began to desire  him to do  as he had ever done unto them  
9	but pilate answered them  saying  will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews  
10	for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy  
11	but the chief priests moved the people  that he should rather release barabbas unto them  
12	and pilate answered and said again unto them  what will ye then that i shall do  unto him  whom ye call the king of the jews  
13	and they cried out again  crucify him  
14	then pilate said unto them  why  what evil hath he done  and they cried out the more exceedingly  crucify him  
15 	and  so  pilate  willing to content the people  released barabbas unto them  and delivered jesus  when he had scourged  him   to be crucified  
16	and the soldiers led him away into the hall  called praetorium  and they call together the whole band  
17	and they clothed him with purple  and platted a crown of thorns  and put it about his  head   
18	and began to salute him  hail  king of the jews  
19	and they smote him on the head with a reed  and did spit upon him  and bowing  their  knees worshipped him  
20	and when they had mocked him  they took off the purple from him  and put his own clothes on him  and led him out to crucify him  
21	and they compel one simon a cyrenian  who passed by  coming out of the country  the father of alexander and rufus  to bear his cross  
22 	and they bring him unto the place golgotha  which is  being interpreted  the place of a skull  
23	and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh  but he received  it  not  
24	and when they had crucified him  they parted his garments  casting lots upon them  what every man should take  
25	and it was the third hour  and they crucified him  
26	and the superscription of his accusation was written over  the king of the jews  
27	and with him they crucify two thieves  the one on his right hand  and the other on his left  
28	and the scripture was fulfilled  which saith  and he was numbered with the transgressors  
29	and they that passed by railed on him  wagging their heads  and saying  ah  thou that destroyest the temple  and buildest  it  in three days  
30	save thyself  and come down from the cross  
31	likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes  he saved others  himself he cannot save  
32	let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross  that we may see and believe  and they that were crucified with him reviled him  
33 	and when the sixth hour was come  there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour  
34	and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice  saying  eloi  eloi  lama sabachthani  which is  being interpreted  my god  my god  why hast thou forsaken me  
35	and some of them that stood by  when they heard  it   said  behold  he calleth elias  
36	and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar  and put  it  on a reed  and gave him to drink  saying  let alone  let us see whether elias will come to take him down  
37	and jesus cried with a loud voice  and gave up the ghost  
38	and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom  
39	and when the centurion  which stood over against him  saw that he so cried out  and gave up the ghost  he said  truly this man was the son of god  
40	there were also women looking on afar off  among whom was mary magdalene  and mary the mother of james the less and of joses  and salome  
41	 who also  when he was in galilee  followed him  and ministered unto him   and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem  
42 	and now when the even was come  because it was the preparation  that is  the day before the sabbath  
43	joseph of arimathaea  an honourable counsellor  which also waited for the kingdom of god  came  and went in boldly unto pilate  and craved the body of jesus  
44	and pilate marvelled if he were already dead  and calling  unto him  the centurion  he asked him whether he had been any while dead  
45	and when he knew  it  of the centurion  he gave the body to joseph  
46	and he bought fine linen  and took him down  and wrapped him in the linen  and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock  and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre  
47	and mary magdalene and mary  the mother  of joses beheld where he was laid  
mark 16
1 	and when the sabbath was past  mary magdalene  and mary the  mother  of james  and salome  had bought sweet spices  that they might come and anoint him  
2	and very early in the morning the first  day  of the week  they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun  
3	and they said among themselves  who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre  
4	and when they looked  they saw that the stone was rolled away  for it was very great  
5	and entering into the sepulchre  they saw a young man sitting on the right side  clothed in a long white garment  and they were affrighted  
6	and he saith unto them  be not affrighted  ye seek jesus of nazareth  which was crucified  he is risen  he is not here  behold the place where they laid him  
7	but go your way  tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee  there shall ye see him  as he said unto you  
8	and they went out quickly  and fled from the sepulchre  for they trembled and were amazed  neither said they any thing to any  man   for they were afraid  
9 	now when  jesus  was risen early the first  day  of the week  he appeared first to mary magdalene  out of whom he had cast seven devils  
10	 and  she went and told them that had been with him  as they mourned and wept  
11	and they  when they had heard that he was alive  and had been seen of her  believed not  
12	after that he appeared in another form unto two of them  as they walked  and went into the country  
13	and they went and told  it  unto the residue  neither believed they them  
14 	afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat  and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart  because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen  
15	and he said unto them  go ye into all the world  and preach the gospel to every creature  
16	he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved  but he that believeth not shall be damned  
17	and these signs shall follow them that believe  in my name shall they cast out devils  they shall speak with new tongues  
18	they shall take up serpents  and if they drink any deadly thing  it shall not hurt them  they shall lay hands on the sick  and they shall recover  
19 	so then after the lord had spoken unto them  he was received up into heaven  and sat on the right hand of god  
20	and they went forth  and preached every where  the lord working with  them   and confirming the word with signs following  amen

luke 1
1 	forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us  
2	even as they delivered them unto us  which from the beginning were eyewitnesses  and ministers of the word  
3	it seemed good to me also  having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first  to write unto thee in order  most excellent theophilus  
4	that thou mightest know the certainty of those things  wherein thou hast been instructed  
5 	there was in the days of herod  the king of judaea  a certain priest named zacharias  of the course of abia  and his wife  was  of the daughters of aaron  and her name  was  elisabeth  
6	and they were both righteous before god  walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless  
7	and they had no child  because that elisabeth was barren  and they both were  now  well stricken in years  
8	and it came to pass  that while he executed the priest s office before god in the order of his course  
9	according to the custom of the priest s office  his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord  
10	and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense  
11	and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense  
12	and when zacharias saw  him   he was troubled  and fear fell upon him  
13	but the angel said unto him  fear not  zacharias  for thy prayer is heard  and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son  and thou shalt call his name john  
14	and thou shalt have joy and gladness  and many shall rejoice at his birth  
15	for he shall be great in the sight of the lord  and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink  and he shall be filled with the holy ghost  even from his mother s womb  
16	and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god  
17	and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias  to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children  and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just  to make ready a people prepared for the lord  
18	and zacharias said unto the angel  whereby shall i know this  for i am an old man  and my wife well stricken in years  
19	and the angel answering said unto him  i am gabriel  that stand in the presence of god  and am sent to speak unto thee  and to shew thee these glad tidings  
20	and  behold  thou shalt be dumb  and not able to speak  until the day that these things shall be performed  because thou believest not my words  which shall be fulfilled in their season  
21	and the people waited for zacharias  and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple  
22	and when he came out  he could not speak unto them  and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple  for he beckoned unto them  and remained speechless  
23	and it came to pass  that  as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished  he departed to his own house  
24	and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived  and hid herself five months  saying  
25	thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on  me   to take away my reproach among men  
26 	and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee  named nazareth  
27	to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph  of the house of david  and the virgin s name  was  mary  
28	and the angel came in unto her  and said  hail   thou that art  highly favoured  the lord  is  with thee  blessed  art  thou among women  
29	and when she saw  him   she was troubled at his saying  and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be  
30	and the angel said unto her  fear not  mary  for thou hast found favour with god  
31	and  behold  thou shalt conceive in thy womb  and bring forth a son  and shalt call his name jesus  
32	he shall be great  and shall be called the son of the highest  and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david  
33	and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever  and of his kingdom there shall be no end  
34	then said mary unto the angel  how shall this be  seeing i know not a man  
35	and the angel answered and said unto her  the holy ghost shall come upon thee  and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee  therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god  
36	and  behold  thy cousin elisabeth  she hath also conceived a son in her old age  and this is the sixth month with her  who was called barren  
37	for with god nothing shall be impossible  
38	and mary said  behold the handmaid of the lord  be it unto me according to thy word  and the angel departed from her  
39 	and mary arose in those days  and went into the hill country with haste  into a city of juda  
40	and entered into the house of zacharias  and saluted elisabeth  
41	and it came to pass  that  when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary  the babe leaped in her womb  and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost  
42	and she spake out with a loud voice  and said  blessed  art  thou among women  and blessed  is  the fruit of thy womb  
43	and whence  is  this to me  that the mother of my lord should come to me  
44	for  lo  as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears  the babe leaped in my womb for joy  
45	and blessed  is  she that believed  for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord  
46	and mary said  my soul doth magnify the lord  
47	and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour  
48	for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden  for  behold  from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed  
49	for he that is mighty hath done to me great things  and holy  is  his name  
50	and his mercy  is  on them that fear him from generation to generation  
51	he hath shewed strength with his arm  he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts  
52	he hath put down the mighty from  their  seats  and exalted them of low degree  
53	he hath filled the hungry with good things  and the rich he hath sent empty away  
54	he hath holpen his servant israel  in remembrance of  his  mercy  
55	as he spake to our fathers  to abraham  and to his seed for ever  
56	and mary abode with her about three months  and returned to her own house  
57 	now elisabeth s full time came that she should be delivered  and she brought forth a son  
58	and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her  and they rejoiced with her  
59	and it came to pass  that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child  and they called him zacharias  after the name of his father  
60	and his mother answered and said  not  so   but he shall be called john  
61	and they said unto her  there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name  
62	and they made signs to his father  how he would have him called  
63	and he asked for a writing table  and wrote  saying  his name is john  and they marvelled all  
64	and his mouth was opened immediately  and his tongue  loosed   and he spake  and praised god  
65	and fear came on all that dwelt round about them  and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea  
66	and all they that heard  them  laid  them  up in their hearts  saying  what manner of child shall this be  and the hand of the lord was with him  
67 	and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost  and prophesied  saying  
68	blessed  be  the lord god of israel  for he hath visited and redeemed his people  
69	and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david  
70	as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets  which have been since the world began  
71	that we should be saved from our enemies  and from the hand of all that hate us  
72	to perform the mercy  promised  to our fathers  and to remember his holy covenant  
73	the oath which he sware to our father abraham  
74	that he would grant unto us  that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear  
75	in holiness and righteousness before him  all the days of our life  
76	and thou  child  shalt be called the prophet of the highest  for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways  
77	to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins  
78	through the tender mercy of our god  whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us  
79	to give light to them that sit in darkness and  in  the shadow of death  to guide our feet into the way of peace  
80	and the child grew  and waxed strong in spirit  and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel  
luke 2
1 	and it came to pass in those days  that there went out a decree from caesar augustus  that all the world should be taxed  
2	  and  this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria   
3	and all went to be taxed  every one into his own city  
4	and joseph also went up from galilee  out of the city of nazareth  into judaea  unto the city of david  which is called bethlehem   because he was of the house and lineage of david   
5	to be taxed with mary his espoused wife  being great with child  
6	and so it was  that  while they were there  the days were accomplished that she should be delivered  
7	and she brought forth her firstborn son  and wrapped him in swaddling clothes  and laid him in a manger  because there was no room for them in the inn  
8 	and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field  keeping watch over their flock by night  
9	and  lo  the angel of the lord came upon them  and the glory of the lord shone round about them  and they were sore afraid  
10	and the angel said unto them  fear not  for  behold  i bring you good tidings of great joy  which shall be to all people  
11	for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour  which is christ the lord  
12	and this  shall be  a sign unto you  ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes  lying in a manger  
13	and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god  and saying  
14	glory to god in the highest  and on earth peace  good will toward men  
15	and it came to pass  as the angels were gone away from them into heaven  the shepherds said one to another  let us now go even unto bethlehem  and see this thing which is come to pass  which the lord hath made known unto us  
16	and they came with haste  and found mary  and joseph  and the babe lying in a manger  
17	and when they had seen  it   they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child  
18	and all they that heard  it  wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds  
19	but mary kept all these things  and pondered  them  in her heart  
20	and the shepherds returned  glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen  as it was told unto them  
21 	and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child  his name was called jesus  which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb  
22	and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished  they brought him to jerusalem  to present  him  to the lord  
23	 as it is written in the law of the lord  every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord   
24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord  a pair of turtledoves  or two young pigeons  
25 	and  behold  there was a man in jerusalem  whose name  was  simeon  and the same man  was  just and devout  waiting for the consolation of israel  and the holy ghost was upon him  
26	and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost  that he should not see death  before he had seen the lord s christ  
27	and he came by the spirit into the temple  and when the parents brought in the child jesus  to do for him after the custom of the law  
28	then took he him up in his arms  and blessed god  and said  
29	lord  now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace  according to thy word  
30	for mine eyes have seen thy salvation  
31	which thou hast prepared before the face of all people  
32	a light to lighten the gentiles  and the glory of thy people israel  
33	and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him  
34	and simeon blessed them  and said unto mary his mother  behold  this  child  is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel  and for a sign which shall be spoken against  
35	 yea  a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also   that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed  
36	and there was one anna  a prophetess  the daughter of phanuel  of the tribe of aser  she was of a great age  and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity  
37	and she  was  a widow of about fourscore and four years  which departed not from the temple  but served  god  with fastings and prayers night and day  
38	and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord  and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem  
39	and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord  they returned into galilee  to their own city nazareth  
40	and the child grew  and waxed strong in spirit  filled with wisdom  and the grace of god was upon him  
41 	now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover  
42	and when he was twelve years old  they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast  
43	and when they had fulfilled the days  as they returned  the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem  and joseph and his mother knew not  of it   
44	but they  supposing him to have been in the company  went a day s journey  and they sought him among  their  kinsfolk and acquaintance  
45	and when they found him not  they turned back again to jerusalem  seeking him  
46	and it came to pass  that after three days they found him in the temple  sitting in the midst of the doctors  both hearing them  and asking them questions  
47	and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers  
48	and when they saw him  they were amazed  and his mother said unto him  son  why hast thou thus dealt with us  behold  thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing  
49	and he said unto them  how is it that ye sought me  wist ye not that i must be about my father s business  
50	and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them  
51	and he went down with them  and came to nazareth  and was subject unto them  but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart  
52	and jesus increased in wisdom and stature  and in favour with god and man

1 	now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar  pontius pilate being governor of judaea  and herod being tetrarch of galilee  and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis  and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene  
2	annas and caiaphas being the high priests  the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness  
3	and he came into all the country about jordan  preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins  
4	as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet  saying  the voice of one crying in the wilderness  prepare ye the way of the lord  make his paths straight  
5	every valley shall be filled  and every mountain and hill shall be brought low  and the crooked shall be made straight  and the rough ways  shall be  made smooth  
6	and all flesh shall see the salvation of god  
7	then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him  o generation of vipers  who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come  
8	bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance  and begin not to say within yourselves  we have abraham to  our  father  for i say unto you  that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham  
9	and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees  every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire  
10	and the people asked him  saying  what shall we do then  
11	he answereth and saith unto them  he that hath two coats  let him impart to him that hath none  and he that hath meat  let him do likewise  
12	then came also publicans to be baptized  and said unto him  master  what shall we do  
13	and he said unto them  exact no more than that which is appointed you  
14	and the soldiers likewise demanded of him  saying  and what shall we do  and he said unto them  do violence to no man  neither accuse  any  falsely  and be content with your wages  
15 	and as the people were in expectation  and all men mused in their hearts of john  whether he were the christ  or not  
16	john answered  saying unto  them  all  i indeed baptize you with water  but one mightier than i cometh  the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose  he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire  
17	whose fan  is  in his hand  and he will throughly purge his floor  and will gather the wheat into his garner  but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable  
18	and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people  
19	but herod the tetrarch  being reproved by him for herodias his brother philip s wife  and for all the evils which herod had done  
20	added yet this above all  that he shut up john in prison  
21 	now when all the people were baptized  it came to pass  that jesus also being baptized  and praying  the heaven was opened  
22	and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him  and a voice came from heaven  which said  thou art my beloved son  in thee i am well pleased

1 	and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan  and was led by the spirit into the wilderness  
2	being forty days tempted of the devil  and in those days he did eat nothing  and when they were ended  he afterward hungered  
3	and the devil said unto him  if thou be the son of god  command this stone that it be made bread  
4	and jesus answered him  saying  it is written  that man shall not live by bread alone  but by every word of god  
5	and the devil  taking him up into an high mountain  shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time  
6	and the devil said unto him  all this power will i give thee  and the glory of them  for that is delivered unto me  and to whomsoever i will i give it  
7	if thou therefore wilt worship me  all shall be thine  
8	and jesus answered and said unto him  get thee behind me  satan  for it is written  thou shalt worship the lord thy god  and him only shalt thou serve  
9	and he brought him to jerusalem  and set him on a pinnacle of the temple  and said unto him  if thou be the son of god  cast thyself down from hence  
10	for it is written  he shall give his angels charge over thee  to keep thee  
11	and in  their  hands they shall bear thee up  lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone  
12	and jesus answering said unto him  it is said  thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god  
13	and when the devil had ended all the temptation  he departed from him for a season  
14 	and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee  and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about  
15	and he taught in their synagogues  being glorified of all  
16	and he came to nazareth  where he had been brought up  and  as his custom was  he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day  and stood up for to read  
17	and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias  and when he had opened the book  he found the place where it was written  
18	the spirit of the lord  is  upon me  because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor  he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted  to preach deliverance to the captives  and recovering of sight to the blind  to set at liberty them that are bruised  
19	to preach the acceptable year of the lord  
20	and he closed the book  and he gave  it  again to the minister  and sat down  and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him  
21	and he began to say unto them  this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears  
22	and all bare him witness  and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth  and they said  is not this joseph s son  
23	and he said unto them  ye will surely say unto me this proverb  physician  heal thyself  whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum  do also here in thy country  
24	and he said  verily i say unto you  no prophet is accepted in his own country  
25	but i tell you of a truth  many widows were in israel in the days of elias  when the heaven was shut up three years and six months  when great famine was throughout all the land  
26	but unto none of them was elias sent  save unto sarepta   a city  of sidon  unto a woman  that was  a widow  
27	and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet  and none of them was cleansed  saving naaman the syrian  
28	and all they in the synagogue  when they heard these things  were filled with wrath  
29	and rose up  and thrust him out of the city  and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built  that they might cast him down headlong  
30	but he passing through the midst of them went his way  
31 	and came down to capernaum  a city of galilee  and taught them on the sabbath days  
32	and they were astonished at his doctrine  for his word was with power  
33	and in the synagogue there was a man  which had a spirit of an unclean devil  and cried out with a loud voice  
34	saying  let  us  alone  what have we to do with thee   thou  jesus of nazareth  art thou come to destroy us  i know thee who thou art  the holy one of god  
35	and jesus rebuked him  saying  hold thy peace  and come out of him  and when the devil had thrown him in the midst  he came out of him  and hurt him not  
36	and they were all amazed  and spake among themselves  saying  what a word  is  this  for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits  and they come out  
37	and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about  
38	and he arose out of the synagogue  and entered into simon s house  and simon s wife s mother was taken with a great fever  and they besought him for her  
39	and he stood over her  and rebuked the fever  and it left her  and immediately she arose and ministered unto them  
40	now when the sun was setting  all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him  and he laid his hands on every one of them  and healed them  
41	and devils also came out of many  crying out  and saying  thou art christ the son of god  and he rebuking  them  suffered them not to speak  for they knew that he was christ  
42	and when it was day  he departed and went into a desert place  and the people sought him  and came unto him  and stayed him  that he should not depart from them  
43	and he said unto them  i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also  for therefore am i sent  
44	and he preached in the synagogues of galilee  
luke 5
1 	and it came to pass  that  as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god  he stood by the lake of gennesaret  
2	and saw two ships standing by the lake  but the fishermen were gone out of them  and were washing  their  nets  
3	and he entered into one of the ships  which was simon s  and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land  and he sat down  and taught the people out of the ship  
4	now when he had left speaking  he said unto simon  launch out into the deep  and let down your nets for a draught  
5	and simon answering said unto him  master  we have toiled all the night  and have taken nothing  nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net  
6	and when they had this done  they inclosed a great multitude of fishes  and their net brake  
7	and they beckoned unto  their  partners  which were in the other ship  that they should come and help them  and they came  and filled both the ships  so that they began to sink  
8	when simon peter saw  it   he fell down at jesus  knees  saying  depart from me  for i am a sinful man  o lord  
9	for he was astonished  and all that were with him  at the draught of the fishes which they had taken  
10	and so  was  also james  and john  the sons of zebedee  which were partners with simon  and jesus said unto simon  fear not  from henceforth thou shalt catch men  
11	and when they had brought their ships to land  they forsook all  and followed him  
12 	and it came to pass  when he was in a certain city  behold a man full of leprosy  who seeing jesus fell on  his  face  and besought him  saying  lord  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  
13	and he put forth  his  hand  and touched him  saying  i will  be thou clean  and immediately the leprosy departed from him  
14	and he charged him to tell no man  but go  and shew thyself to the priest  and offer for thy cleansing  according as moses commanded  for a testimony unto them  
15	but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him  and great multitudes came together to hear  and to be healed by him of their infirmities  
16	and he withdrew himself into the wilderness  and prayed  
17 	and it came to pass on a certain day  as he was teaching  that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by  which were come out of every town of galilee  and judaea  and jerusalem  and the power of the lord was  present  to heal them  
18	and  behold  men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy  and they sought  means  to bring him in  and to lay  him  before him  
19	and when they could not find by what  way  they might bring him in because of the multitude  they went upon the housetop  and let him down through the tiling with  his  couch into the midst before jesus  
20	and when he saw their faith  he said unto him  man  thy sins are forgiven thee  
21	and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason  saying  who is this which speaketh blasphemies  who can forgive sins  but god alone  
22	but when jesus perceived their thoughts  he answering said unto them  what reason ye in your hearts  
23	whether is easier  to say  thy sins be forgiven thee  or to say  rise up and walk  
24	but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins   he said unto the sick of the palsy   i say unto thee  arise  and take up thy couch  and go into thine house  
25	and immediately he rose up before them  and took up that whereon he lay  and departed to his own house  glorifying god  
26	and they were all amazed  and they glorified god  and were filled with fear  saying  we have seen strange things to day  
27 	and after these things he went forth  and saw a publican  named levi  sitting at the receipt of custom  and he said unto him  follow me  
28	and he left all  rose up  and followed him  
29	and levi made him a great feast in his own house  and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them  
30	but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples  saying  why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners  
31	and jesus answering said unto them  they that are whole need not a physician  but they that are sick  
32	i came not to call the righteous  but sinners to repentance  
33	and they said unto him  why do the disciples of john fast often  and make prayers  and likewise  the disciples  of the pharisees  but thine eat and drink  
34	and he said unto them  can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast  while the bridegroom is with them  
35	but the days will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them  and then shall they fast in those days  
36	and he spake also a parable unto them  no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old  if otherwise  then both the new maketh a rent  and the piece that was  taken  out of the new agreeth not with the old  
37	and no man putteth new wine into old bottles  else the new wine will burst the bottles  and be spilled  and the bottles shall perish  
38	but new wine must be put into new bottles  and both are preserved  
39	no man also having drunk old  wine  straightway desireth new  for he saith  the old is better  
luke 6
1 	and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first  that he went through the corn fields  and his disciples plucked the ears of corn  and did eat  rubbing  them  in  their  hands  
2	and certain of the pharisees said unto them  why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days  
3	and jesus answering them said  have ye not read so much as this  what david did  when himself was an hungred  and they which were with him  
4	how he went into the house of god  and did take and eat the shewbread  and gave also to them that were with him  which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone  
5	and he said unto them  that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath  
6	and it came to pass also on another sabbath  that he entered into the synagogue and taught  and there was a man whose right hand was withered  
7	and the scribes and pharisees watched him  whether he would heal on the sabbath day  that they might find an accusation against him  
8	but he knew their thoughts  and said to the man which had the withered hand  rise up  and stand forth in the midst  and he arose and stood forth  
9	then said jesus unto them  i will ask you one thing  is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good  or to do evil  to save life  or to destroy  it   
10	and looking round about upon them all  he said unto the man  stretch forth thy hand  and he did so  and his hand was restored whole as the other  
11	and they were filled with madness  and communed one with another what they might do to jesus  
12 	and it came to pass in those days  that he went out into a mountain to pray  and continued all night in prayer to god  
13	and when it was day  he called  unto him  his disciples  and of them he chose twelve  whom also he named apostles  
14	simon   whom he also named peter   and andrew his brother  james and john  philip and bartholomew  
15	matthew and thomas  james the  son  of alphaeus  and simon called zelotes  
16	and judas  the brother  of james  and judas iscariot  which also was the traitor  
17	and he came down with them  and stood in the plain  and the company of his disciples  and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem  and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon  which came to hear him  and to be healed of their diseases  
18	and they that were vexed with unclean spirits  and they were healed  
19	and the whole multitude sought to touch him  for there went virtue out of him  and healed  them  all  
20 	and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples  and said  blessed  be ye  poor  for yours is the kingdom of god  
21	blessed  are ye  that hunger now  for ye shall be filled  blessed  are ye  that weep now  for ye shall laugh  
22	blessed are ye  when men shall hate you  and when they shall separate you  from their company   and shall reproach  you   and cast out your name as evil  for the son of man s sake  
23	rejoice ye in that day  and leap for joy  for  behold  your reward  is  great in heaven  for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets  
24	but woe unto you that are rich  for ye have received your consolation  
25	woe unto you that are full  for ye shall hunger  woe unto you that laugh now  for ye shall mourn and weep  
26	woe unto you  when all men shall speak well of you  for so did their fathers to the false prophets  
27 	but i say unto you which hear  love your enemies  do good to them which hate you  
28	bless them that curse you  and pray for them which despitefully use you  
29	and unto him that smiteth thee on the  one  cheek offer also the other  and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not  to take thy  coat also  
30	give to every man that asketh of thee  and of him that taketh away thy goods ask  them  not again  
31	and as ye would that men should do to you  do ye also to them likewise  
32	for if ye love them which love you  what thank have ye  for sinners also love those that love them  
33	and if ye do good to them which do good to you  what thank have ye  for sinners also do even the same  
34	and if ye lend  to them  of whom ye hope to receive  what thank have ye  for sinners also lend to sinners  to receive as much again  
35	but love ye your enemies  and do good  and lend  hoping for nothing again  and your reward shall be great  and ye shall be the children of the highest  for he is kind unto the unthankful and  to  the evil  
36	be ye therefore merciful  as your father also is merciful  
37 	judge not  and ye shall not be judged  condemn not  and ye shall not be condemned  forgive  and ye shall be forgiven  
38	give  and it shall be given unto you  good measure  pressed down  and shaken together  and running over  shall men give into your bosom  for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again  
39	and he spake a parable unto them  can the blind lead the blind  shall they not both fall into the ditch  
40	the disciple is not above his master  but every one that is perfect shall be as his master  
41	and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye  but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye  
42	either how canst thou say to thy brother  brother  let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye  when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye  thou hypocrite  cast out first the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother s eye  
43	for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit  neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit  
44	for every tree is known by his own fruit  for of thorns men do not gather figs  nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes  
45	a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good  and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil  for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh  
46	and why call ye me  lord  lord  and do not the things which i say  
47	whosoever cometh to me  and heareth my sayings  and doeth them  i will shew you to whom he is like  
48	he is like a man which built an house  and digged deep  and laid the foundation on a rock  and when the flood arose  the stream beat vehemently upon that house  and could not shake it  for it was founded upon a rock  
49	but he that heareth  and doeth not  is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth  against which the stream did beat vehemently  and immediately it fell  and the ruin of that house was great  
luke 7
1 	now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people  he entered into capernaum  
2	and a certain centurion s servant  who was dear unto him  was sick  and ready to die  
3	and when he heard of jesus  he sent unto him the elders of the jews  beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant  
4	and when they came to jesus  they besought him instantly  saying  that he was worthy for whom he should do this  
5	for he loveth our nation  and he hath built us a synagogue  
6	then jesus went with them  and when he was now not far from the house  the centurion sent friends to him  saying unto him  lord  trouble not thyself  for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof  
7	wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee  but say in a word  and my servant shall be healed  
8	for i also am a man set under authority  having under me soldiers  and i say unto one  go  and he goeth  and to another  come  and he cometh  and to my servant  do this  and he doeth  it   
9	when jesus heard these things  he marvelled at him  and turned him about  and said unto the people that followed him  i say unto you  i have not found so great faith  no  not in israel  
10	and they that were sent  returning to the house  found the servant whole that had been sick  
11 	and it came to pass the day after  that he went into a city called nain  and many of his disciples went with him  and much people  
12	now when he came nigh to the gate of the city  behold  there was a dead man carried out  the only son of his mother  and she was a widow  and much people of the city was with her  
13	and when the lord saw her  he had compassion on her  and said unto her  weep not  
14	and he came and touched the bier  and they that bare  him  stood still  and he said  young man  i say unto thee  arise  
15	and he that was dead sat up  and began to speak  and he delivered him to his mother  
16	and there came a fear on all  and they glorified god  saying  that a great prophet is risen up among us  and  that god hath visited his people  
17	and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea  and throughout all the region round about  
18	and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things  
19 	and john calling  unto him  two of his disciples sent  them  to jesus  saying  art thou he that should come  or look we for another  
20	when the men were come unto him  they said  john baptist hath sent us unto thee  saying  art thou he that should come  or look we for another  
21	and in that same hour he cured many of  their  infirmities and plagues  and of evil spirits  and unto many  that were  blind he gave sight  
22	then jesus answering said unto them  go your way  and tell john what things ye have seen and heard  how that the blind see  the lame walk  the lepers are cleansed  the deaf hear  the dead are raised  to the poor the gospel is preached  
23	and blessed is  he   whosoever shall not be offended in me  
24	and when the messengers of john were departed  he began to speak unto the people concerning john  what went ye out into the wilderness for to see  a reed shaken with the wind  
25	but what went ye out for to see  a man clothed in soft raiment  behold  they which are gorgeously apparelled  and live delicately  are in kings  courts  
26	but what went ye out for to see  a prophet  yea  i say unto you  and much more than a prophet  
27	this is  he   of whom it is written  behold  i send my messenger before thy face  which shall prepare thy way before thee  
28	for i say unto you  among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist  but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he  
29	and all the people that heard  him   and the publicans  justified god  being baptized with the baptism of john  
30	but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves  being not baptized of him  
31	and the lord said  whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation  and to what are they like  
32	they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace  and calling one to another  and saying  we have piped unto you  and ye have not danced  we have mourned to you  and ye have not wept  
33	for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine  and ye say  he hath a devil  
34	the son of man is come eating and drinking  and ye say  behold a gluttonous man  and a winebibber  a friend of publicans and sinners  
35	but wisdom is justified of all her children  
36 	and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him  and he went into the pharisee s house  and sat down to meat  
37	and  behold  a woman in the city  which was a sinner  when she knew that  jesus  sat at meat in the pharisee s house  brought an alabaster box of ointment  
38	and stood at his feet behind  him  weeping  and began to wash his feet with tears  and did wipe  them  with the hairs of her head  and kissed his feet  and anointed  them  with the ointment  
39	now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw  it   he spake within himself  saying  this man  if he were a prophet  would have known who and what manner of woman  this is  that toucheth him  for she is a sinner  
40	and jesus answering said unto him  simon  i have somewhat to say unto thee  and he saith  master  say on  
41	there was a certain creditor which had two debtors  the one owed five hundred pence  and the other fifty  
42	and when they had nothing to pay  he frankly forgave them both  tell me therefore  which of them will love him most  
43	simon answered and said  i suppose that  he   to whom he forgave most  and he said unto him  thou hast rightly judged  
44	and he turned to the woman  and said unto simon  seest thou this woman  i entered into thine house  thou gavest me no water for my feet  but she hath washed my feet with tears  and wiped  them  with the hairs of her head  
45	thou gavest me no kiss  but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet  
46	my head with oil thou didst not anoint  but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment  
47	wherefore i say unto thee  her sins  which are many  are forgiven  for she loved much  but to whom little is forgiven   the same  loveth little  
48	and he said unto her  thy sins are forgiven  
49	and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves  who is this that forgiveth sins also  
50	and he said to the woman  thy faith hath saved thee  go in peace  
luke 8
1 	and it came to pass afterward  that he went throughout every city and village  preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god  and the twelve  were  with him  
2	and certain women  which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities  mary called magdalene  out of whom went seven devils  
3	and joanna the wife of chuza herod s steward  and susanna  and many others  which ministered unto him of their substance  
4 	and when much people were gathered together  and were come to him out of every city  he spake by a parable  
5	a sower went out to sow his seed  and as he sowed  some fell by the way side  and it was trodden down  and the fowls of the air devoured it  
6	and some fell upon a rock  and as soon as it was sprung up  it withered away  because it lacked moisture  
7	and some fell among thorns  and the thorns sprang up with it  and choked it  
8	and other fell on good ground  and sprang up  and bare fruit an hundredfold  and when he had said these things  he cried  he that hath ears to hear  let him hear  
9	and his disciples asked him  saying  what might this parable be  
10	and he said  unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god  but to others in parables  that seeing they might not see  and hearing they might not understand  
11	now the parable is this  the seed is the word of god  
12	those by the way side are they that hear  then cometh the devil  and taketh away the word out of their hearts  lest they should believe and be saved  
13	they on the rock  are they   which  when they hear  receive the word with joy  and these have no root  which for a while believe  and in time of temptation fall away  
14	and that which fell among thorns are they  which  when they have heard  go forth  and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of  this  life  and bring no fruit to perfection  
15	but that on the good ground are they  which in an honest and good heart  having heard the word  keep  it   and bring forth fruit with patience  
16	no man  when he hath lighted a candle  covereth it with a vessel  or putteth  it  under a bed  but setteth  it  on a candlestick  that they which enter in may see the light  
17	for nothing is secret  that shall not be made manifest  neither  any thing  hid  that shall not be known and come abroad  
18	take heed therefore how ye hear  for whosoever hath  to him shall be given  and whosoever hath not  from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have  
19	then came to him  his  mother and his brethren  and could not come at him for the press  
20	and it was told him  by certain  which said  thy mother and thy brethren stand without  desiring to see thee  
21	and he answered and said unto them  my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god  and do it  
22 	now it came to pass on a certain day  that he went into a ship with his disciples  and he said unto them  let us go over unto the other side of the lake  and they launched forth  
23	but as they sailed he fell asleep  and there came down a storm of wind on the lake  and they were filled  with water   and were in jeopardy  
24	and they came to him  and awoke him  saying  master  master  we perish  then he arose  and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water  and they ceased  and there was a calm  
25	and he said unto them  where is your faith  and they being afraid wondered  saying one to another  what manner of man is this  for he commandeth even the winds and water  and they obey him  
26	and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes  which is over against galilee  
27	and when he went forth to land  there met him out of the city a certain man  which had devils long time  and ware no clothes  neither abode in  any  house  but in the tombs  
28	when he saw jesus  he cried out  and fell down before him  and with a loud voice said  what have i to do with thee  jesus   thou  son of god most high  i beseech thee  torment me not  
29	 for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man  for oftentimes it had caught him  and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters  and he brake the bands  and was driven of the devil into the wilderness   
30	and jesus asked him  saying  what is thy name  and he said  legion  because many devils were entered into him  
31	and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep  
32	and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain  and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them  and he suffered them  
33	then went the devils out of the man  and entered into the swine  and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake  and were choked  
34	when they that fed  them  saw what was done  they fled  and went and told  it  in the city and in the country  
35	then they went out to see what was done  and came to jesus  and found the man  out of whom the devils were departed  sitting at the feet of jesus  clothed  and in his right mind  and they were afraid  
36	they also which saw  it  told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed  
37	then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them  for they were taken with great fear  and he went up into the ship  and returned back again  
38	now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him  but jesus sent him away  saying  
39	return to thine own house  and shew how great things god hath done unto thee  and he went his way  and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him  
40 	and it came to pass  that  when jesus was returned  the people  gladly  received him  for they were all waiting for him  
41	and  behold  there came a man named jairus  and he was a ruler of the synagogue  and he fell down at jesus  feet  and besought him that he would come into his house  
42	for he had one only daughter  about twelve years of age  and she lay a dying  but as he went the people thronged him  
43	and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years  which had spent all her living upon physicians  neither could be healed of any  
44	came behind  him   and touched the border of his garment  and immediately her issue of blood stanched  
45	and jesus said  who touched me  when all denied  peter and they that were with him said  master  the multitude throng thee and press  thee   and sayest thou  who touched me  
46	and jesus said  somebody hath touched me  for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me  
47	and when the woman saw that she was not hid  she came trembling  and falling down before him  she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him  and how she was healed immediately  
48	and he said unto her  daughter  be of good comfort  thy faith hath made thee whole  go in peace  
49	while he yet spake  there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue s  house   saying to him  thy daughter is dead  trouble not the master  
50	but when jesus heard  it   he answered him  saying  fear not  believe only  and she shall be made whole  
51	and when he came into the house  he suffered no man to go in  save peter  and james  and john  and the father and the mother of the maiden  
52	and all wept  and bewailed her  but he said  weep not  she is not dead  but sleepeth  
53	and they laughed him to scorn  knowing that she was dead  
54	and he put them all out  and took her by the hand  and called  saying  maid  arise  
55	and her spirit came again  and she arose straightway  and he commanded to give her meat  
56	and her parents were astonished  but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done  
luke 9
1 	then he called his twelve disciples together  and gave them power and authority over all devils  and to cure diseases  
2	and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god  and to heal the sick  
3	and he said unto them  take nothing for  your  journey  neither staves  nor scrip  neither bread  neither money  neither have two coats apiece  
4	and whatsoever house ye enter into  there abide  and thence depart  
5	and whosoever will not receive you  when ye go out of that city  shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them  
6	and they departed  and went through the towns  preaching the gospel  and healing every where  
7	now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him  and he was perplexed  because that it was said of some  that john was risen from the dead  
8	and of some  that elias had appeared  and of others  that one of the old prophets was risen again  
9	and herod said  john have i beheaded  but who is this  of whom i hear such things  and he desired to see him  
10 	and the apostles  when they were returned  told him all that they had done  and he took them  and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida  
11	and the people  when they knew  it   followed him  and he received them  and spake unto them of the kingdom of god  and healed them that had need of healing  
12	and when the day began to wear away  then came the twelve  and said unto him  send the multitude away  that they may go into the towns and country round about  and lodge  and get victuals  for we are here in a desert place  
13	but he said unto them  give ye them to eat  and they said  we have no more but five loaves and two fishes  except we should go and buy meat for all this people  
14	for they were about five thousand men  and he said to his disciples  make them sit down by fifties in a company  
15	and they did so  and made them all sit down  
16	then he took the five loaves and the two fishes  and looking up to heaven  he blessed them  and brake  and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude  
17	and they did eat  and were all filled  and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets  
18 	and it came to pass  as he was alone praying  his disciples were with him  and he asked them  saying  whom say the people that i am  
19	they answering said  john the baptist  but some  say   elias  and others  say   that one of the old prophets is risen again  
20	he said unto them  but whom say ye that i am  peter answering said  the christ of god  
21	and he straitly charged them  and commanded  them  to tell no man that thing  
22	saying  the son of man must suffer many things  and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes  and be slain  and be raised the third day  
23	and he said to  them  all  if any  man  will come after me  let him deny himself  and take up his cross daily  and follow me  
24	for whosoever will save his life shall lose it  but whosoever will lose his life for my sake  the same shall save it  
25	for what is a man advantaged  if he gain the whole world  and lose himself  or be cast away  
26	for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words  of him shall the son of man be ashamed  when he shall come in his own glory  and  in his  father s  and of the holy angels  
27	but i tell you of a truth  there be some standing here  which shall not taste of death  till they see the kingdom of god  
28 	and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings  he took peter and john and james  and went up into a mountain to pray  
29	and as he prayed  the fashion of his countenance was altered  and his raiment  was  white  and  glistering  
30	and  behold  there talked with him two men  which were moses and elias  
31	who appeared in glory  and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem  
32	but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep  and when they were awake  they saw his glory  and the two men that stood with him  
33	and it came to pass  as they departed from him  peter said unto jesus  master  it is good for us to be here  and let us make three tabernacles  one for thee  and one for moses  and one for elias  not knowing what he said  
34	while he thus spake  there came a cloud  and overshadowed them  and they feared as they entered into the cloud  
35	and there came a voice out of the cloud  saying  this is my beloved son  hear him  
36	and when the voice was past  jesus was found alone  and they kept  it  close  and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen  
37 	and it came to pass  that on the next day  when they were come down from the hill  much people met him  
38	and  behold  a man of the company cried out  saying  master  i beseech thee  look upon my son  for he is mine only child  
39	and  lo  a spirit taketh him  and he suddenly crieth out  and it teareth him that he foameth again  and bruising him hardly departeth from him  
40	and i besought thy disciples to cast him out  and they could not  
41	and jesus answering said  o faithless and perverse generation  how long shall i be with you  and suffer you  bring thy son hither  
42	and as he was yet a coming  the devil threw him down  and tare  him   and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit  and healed the child  and delivered him again to his father  
43 	and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god  but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did  he said unto his disciples  
44	let these sayings sink down into your ears  for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men  
45	but they understood not this saying  and it was hid from them  that they perceived it not  and they feared to ask him of that saying  
46	then there arose a reasoning among them  which of them should be greatest  
47	and jesus  perceiving the thought of their heart  took a child  and set him by him  
48	and said unto them  whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me  and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me  for he that is least among you all  the same shall be great  
49	and john answered and said  master  we saw one casting out devils in thy name  and we forbad him  because he followeth not with us  
50	and jesus said unto him  forbid  him  not  for he that is not against us is for us  
51 	and it came to pass  when the time was come that he should be received up  he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem  
52	and sent messengers before his face  and they went  and entered into a village of the samaritans  to make ready for him  
53	and they did not receive him  because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem  
54	and when his disciples james and john saw  this   they said  lord  wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven  and consume them  even as elias did  
55	but he turned  and rebuked them  and said  ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of  
56	for the son of man is not come to destroy men s lives  but to save  them   and they went to another village  
57 	and it came to pass  that  as they went in the way  a certain  man  said unto him  lord  i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest  
58	and jesus said unto him  foxes have holes  and birds of the air  have  nests  but the son of man hath not where to lay  his  head  
59	and he said unto another  follow me  but he said  lord  suffer me first to go and bury my father  
60	jesus said unto him  let the dead bury their dead  but go thou and preach the kingdom of god  
61	and another also said  lord  i will follow thee  but let me first go bid them farewell  which are at home at my house  
62	and jesus said unto him  no man  having put his hand to the plough  and looking back  is fit for the kingdom of god  
luke 10
1 	after these things the lord appointed other seventy also  and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place  whither he himself would come  
2	therefore said he unto them  the harvest truly  is  great  but the labourers  are  few  pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest  that he would send forth labourers into his harvest  
3	go your ways  behold  i send you forth as lambs among wolves  
4	carry neither purse  nor scrip  nor shoes  and salute no man by the way  
5	and into whatsoever house ye enter  first say  peace  be  to this house  
6	and if the son of peace be there  your peace shall rest upon it  if not  it shall turn to you again  
7	and in the same house remain  eating and drinking such things as they give  for the labourer is worthy of his hire  go not from house to house  
8	and into whatsoever city ye enter  and they receive you  eat such things as are set before you  
9	and heal the sick that are therein  and say unto them  the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you  
10	but into whatsoever city ye enter  and they receive you not  go your ways out into the streets of the same  and say  
11	even the very dust of your city  which cleaveth on us  we do wipe off against you  notwithstanding be ye sure of this  that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you  
12	but i say unto you  that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom  than for that city  
13	woe unto thee  chorazin  woe unto thee  bethsaida  for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon  which have been done in you  they had a great while ago repented  sitting in sackcloth and ashes  
14	but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment  than for you  
15	and thou  capernaum  which art exalted to heaven  shalt be thrust down to hell  
16	he that heareth you heareth me  and he that despiseth you despiseth me  and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me  
17 	and the seventy returned again with joy  saying  lord  even the devils are subject unto us through thy name  
18	and he said unto them  i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven  
19	behold  i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions  and over all the power of the enemy  and nothing shall by any means hurt you  
20	notwithstanding in this rejoice not  that the spirits are subject unto you  but rather rejoice  because your names are written in heaven  
21	in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit  and said  i thank thee  o father  lord of heaven and earth  that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent  and hast revealed them unto babes  even so  father  for so it seemed good in thy sight  
22	all things are delivered to me of my father  and no man knoweth who the son is  but the father  and who the father is  but the son  and  he  to whom the son will reveal  him   
23	and he turned him unto  his  disciples  and said privately  blessed  are  the eyes which see the things that ye see  
24	for i tell you  that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see  and have not seen  them   and to hear those things which ye hear  and have not heard  them   
25 	and  behold  a certain lawyer stood up  and tempted him  saying  master  what shall i do to inherit eternal life  
26	he said unto him  what is written in the law  how readest thou  
27	and he answering said  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart  and with all thy soul  and with all thy strength  and with all thy mind  and thy neighbour as thyself  
28	and he said unto him  thou hast answered right  this do  and thou shalt live  
29	but he  willing to justify himself  said unto jesus  and who is my neighbour  
30	and jesus answering said  a certain  man  went down from jerusalem to jericho  and fell among thieves  which stripped him of his raiment  and wounded  him   and departed  leaving  him  half dead  
31	and by chance there came down a certain priest that way  and when he saw him  he passed by on the other side  
32	and likewise a levite  when he was at the place  came and looked  on him   and passed by on the other side  
33	but a certain samaritan  as he journeyed  came where he was  and when he saw him  he had compassion  on him   
34	and went to  him   and bound up his wounds  pouring in oil and wine  and set him on his own beast  and brought him to an inn  and took care of him  
35	and on the morrow when he departed  he took out two pence  and gave  them  to the host  and said unto him  take care of him  and whatsoever thou spendest more  when i come again  i will repay thee  
36	which now of these three  thinkest thou  was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves  
37	and he said  he that shewed mercy on him  then said jesus unto him  go  and do thou likewise  
38 	now it came to pass  as they went  that he entered into a certain village  and a certain woman named martha received him into her house  
39	and she had a sister called mary  which also sat at jesus  feet  and heard his word  
40	but martha was cumbered about much serving  and came to him  and said  lord  dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone  bid her therefore that she help me  
41	and jesus answered and said unto her  martha  martha  thou art careful and troubled about many things  
42	but one thing is needful  and mary hath chosen that good part  which shall not be taken away from her  
luke 11
1 	and it came to pass  that  as he was praying in a certain place  when he ceased  one of his disciples said unto him  lord  teach us to pray  as john also taught his disciples  
2	and he said unto them  when ye pray  say  our father which art in heaven  hallowed be thy name  thy kingdom come  thy will be done  as in heaven  so in earth  
3	give us day by day our daily bread  
4	and forgive us our sins  for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us  and lead us not into temptation  but deliver us from evil  
5	and he said unto them  which of you shall have a friend  and shall go unto him at midnight  and say unto him  friend  lend me three loaves  
6	for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me  and i have nothing to set before him  
7	and he from within shall answer and say  trouble me not  the door is now shut  and my children are with me in bed  i cannot rise and give thee  
8	i say unto you  though he will not rise and give him  because he is his friend  yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth  
9	and i say unto you  ask  and it shall be given you  seek  and ye shall find  knock  and it shall be opened unto you  
10	for every one that asketh receiveth  and he that seeketh findeth  and to him that knocketh it shall be opened  
11	if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father  will he give him a stone  or if  he ask  a fish  will he for a fish give him a serpent  
12	or if he shall ask an egg  will he offer him a scorpion  
13	if ye then  being evil  know how to give good gifts unto your children  how much more shall  your  heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him  
14 	and he was casting out a devil  and it was dumb  and it came to pass  when the devil was gone out  the dumb spake  and the people wondered  
15	but some of them said  he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils  
16	and others  tempting  him   sought of him a sign from heaven  
17	but he  knowing their thoughts  said unto them  every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation  and a house  divided  against a house falleth  
18	if satan also be divided against himself  how shall his kingdom stand  because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub  
19	and if i by beelzebub cast out devils  by whom do your sons cast  them  out  therefore shall they be your judges  
20	but if i with the finger of god cast out devils  no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you  
21	when a strong man armed keepeth his palace  his goods are in peace  
22	but when a stronger than he shall come upon him  and overcome him  he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted  and divideth his spoils  
23	he that is not with me is against me  and he that gathereth not with me scattereth  
24	when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man  he walketh through dry places  seeking rest  and finding none  he saith  i will return unto my house whence i came out  
25	and when he cometh  he findeth  it  swept and garnished  
26	then goeth he  and taketh  to him  seven other spirits more wicked than himself  and they enter in  and dwell there  and the last  state  of that man is worse than the first  
27 	and it came to pass  as he spake these things  a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice  and said unto him  blessed  is  the womb that bare thee  and the paps which thou hast sucked  
28	but he said  yea rather  blessed  are  they that hear the word of god  and keep it  
29 	and when the people were gathered thick together  he began to say  this is an evil generation  they seek a sign  and there shall no sign be given it  but the sign of jonas the prophet  
30	for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites  so shall also the son of man be to this generation  
31	the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation  and condemn them  for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon  and  behold  a greater than solomon  is  here  
32	the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation  and shall condemn it  for they repented at the preaching of jonas  and  behold  a greater than jonas  is  here  
33	no man  when he hath lighted a candle  putteth  it  in a secret place  neither under a bushel  but on a candlestick  that they which come in may see the light  
34	the light of the body is the eye  therefore when thine eye is single  thy whole body also is full of light  but when  thine eye  is evil  thy body also  is  full of darkness  
35	take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness  
36	if thy whole body therefore  be  full of light  having no part dark  the whole shall be full of light  as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light  
37 	and as he spake  a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him  and he went in  and sat down to meat  
38	and when the pharisee saw  it   he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner  
39	and the lord said unto him  now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter  but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness  
40	 ye  fools  did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also  
41	but rather give alms of such things as ye have  and  behold  all things are clean unto you  
42	but woe unto you  pharisees  for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs  and pass over judgment and the love of god  these ought ye to have done  and not to leave the other undone  
43	woe unto you  pharisees  for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues  and greetings in the markets  
44	woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites  for ye are as graves which appear not  and the men that walk over  them  are not aware  of them   
45	then answered one of the lawyers  and said unto him  master  thus saying thou reproachest us also  
46	and he said  woe unto you also   ye  lawyers  for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne  and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers  
47	woe unto you  for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets  and your fathers killed them  
48	truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers  for they indeed killed them  and ye build their sepulchres  
49	therefore also said the wisdom of god  i will send them prophets and apostles  and  some  of them they shall slay and persecute  
50	that the blood of all the prophets  which was shed from the foundation of the world  may be required of this generation  
51	from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias  which perished between the altar and the temple  verily i say unto you  it shall be required of this generation  
52	woe unto you  lawyers  for ye have taken away the key of knowledge  ye entered not in yourselves  and them that were entering in ye hindered  
53	and as he said these things unto them  the scribes and the pharisees began to urge  him  vehemently  and to provoke him to speak of many things  
54	laying wait for him  and seeking to catch something out of his mouth  that they might accuse him  
luke 12
1 	in the mean time  when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people  insomuch that they trode one upon another  he began to say unto his disciples first of all  beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees  which is hypocrisy  
2	for there is nothing covered  that shall not be revealed  neither hid  that shall not be known  
3	therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light  and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops  
4	and i say unto you my friends  be not afraid of them that kill the body  and after that have no more that they can do  
5	but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear  fear him  which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell  yea  i say unto you  fear him  
6	are not five sparrows sold for two farthings  and not one of them is forgotten before god  
7	but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered  fear not therefore  ye are of more value than many sparrows  
8	also i say unto you  whosoever shall confess me before men  him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god  
9	but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god  
10	and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man  it shall be forgiven him  but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven  
11	and when they bring you unto the synagogues  and  unto  magistrates  and powers  take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer  or what ye shall say  
12	for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say  
13 	and one of the company said unto him  master  speak to my brother  that he divide the inheritance with me  
14	and he said unto him  man  who made me a judge or a divider over you  
15	and he said unto them  take heed  and beware of covetousness  for a man s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth  
16	and he spake a parable unto them  saying  the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully  
17	and he thought within himself  saying  what shall i do  because i have no room where to bestow my fruits  
18	and he said  this will i do  i will pull down my barns  and build greater  and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods  
19	and i will say to my soul  soul  thou hast much goods laid up for many years  take thine ease  eat  drink   and  be merry  
20	but god said unto him   thou  fool  this night thy soul shall be required of thee  then whose shall those things be  which thou hast provided  
21	so  is  he that layeth up treasure for himself  and is not rich toward god  
22 	and he said unto his disciples  therefore i say unto you  take no thought for your life  what ye shall eat  neither for the body  what ye shall put on  
23	the life is more than meat  and the body  is more  than raiment  
24	consider the ravens  for they neither sow nor reap  which neither have storehouse nor barn  and god feedeth them  how much more are ye better than the fowls  
25	and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit  
26	if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least  why take ye thought for the rest  
27	consider the lilies how they grow  they toil not  they spin not  and yet i say unto you  that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these  
28	if then god so clothe the grass  which is to day in the field  and to morrow is cast into the oven  how much more  will he clothe  you  o ye of little faith  
29	and seek not ye what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink  neither be ye of doubtful mind  
30	for all these things do the nations of the world seek after  and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things  
31	but rather seek ye the kingdom of god  and all these things shall be added unto you  
32	fear not  little flock  for it is your father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom  
33	sell that ye have  and give alms  provide yourselves bags which wax not old  a treasure in the heavens that faileth not  where no thief approacheth  neither moth corrupteth  
34	for where your treasure is  there will your heart be also  
35	let your loins be girded about  and  your  lights burning  
36	and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord  when he will return from the wedding  that when he cometh and knocketh  they may open unto him immediately  
37	blessed  are  those servants  whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching  verily i say unto you  that he shall gird himself  and make them to sit down to meat  and will come forth and serve them  
38	and if he shall come in the second watch  or come in the third watch  and find  them  so  blessed are those servants  
39	and this know  that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come  he would have watched  and not have suffered his house to be broken through  
40	be ye therefore ready also  for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not  
41 	then peter said unto him  lord  speakest thou this parable unto us  or even to all  
42	and the lord said  who then is that faithful and wise steward  whom  his  lord shall make ruler over his household  to give  them their  portion of meat in due season  
43	blessed  is  that servant  whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing  
44	of a truth i say unto you  that he will make him ruler over all that he hath  
45	but and if that servant say in his heart  my lord delayeth his coming  and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens  and to eat and drink  and to be drunken  
46	the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for  him   and at an hour when he is not aware  and will cut him in sunder  and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers  
47	and that servant  which knew his lord s will  and prepared not  himself   neither did according to his will  shall be beaten with many  stripes   
48	but he that knew not  and did commit things worthy of stripes  shall be beaten with few  stripes   for unto whomsoever much is given  of him shall be much required  and to whom men have committed much  of him they will ask the more  
49	i am come to send fire on the earth  and what will i  if it be already kindled  
50	but i have a baptism to be baptized with  and how am i straitened till it be accomplished  
51	suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth  i tell you  nay  but rather division  
52	for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided  three against two  and two against three  
53	the father shall be divided against the son  and the son against the father  the mother against the daughter  and the daughter against the mother  the mother in law against her daughter in law  and the daughter in law against her mother in law  
54 	and he said also to the people  when ye see a cloud rise out of the west  straightway ye say  there cometh a shower  and so it is  
55	and when  ye see  the south wind blow  ye say  there will be heat  and it cometh to pass  
56	 ye  hypocrites  ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth  but how is it that ye do not discern this time  
57	yea  and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right  
58	when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate   as thou art  in the way  give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him  lest he hale thee to the judge  and the judge deliver thee to the officer  and the officer cast thee into prison  
59	i tell thee  thou shalt not depart thence  till thou hast paid the very last mite  
luke 13
1 	there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans  whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices  
2	and jesus answering said unto them  suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans  because they suffered such things  
3	i tell you  nay  but  except ye repent  ye shall all likewise perish  
4	or those eighteen  upon whom the tower in siloam fell  and slew them  think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem  
5	i tell you  nay  but  except ye repent  ye shall all likewise perish  
6 	he spake also this parable  a certain  man  had a fig tree planted in his vineyard  and he came and sought fruit thereon  and found none  
7	then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard  behold  these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree  and find none  cut it down  why cumbereth it the ground  
8	and he answering said unto him  lord  let it alone this year also  till i shall dig about it  and dung  it   
9	and if it bear fruit   well   and if not   then  after that thou shalt cut it down  
10 	and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath  
11	and  behold  there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years  and was bowed together  and could in no wise lift up  herself   
12	and when jesus saw her  he called  her to him   and said unto her  woman  thou art loosed from thine infirmity  
13	and he laid  his  hands on her  and immediately she was made straight  and glorified god  
14	and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation  because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day  and said unto the people  there are six days in which men ought to work  in them therefore come and be healed  and not on the sabbath day  
15	the lord then answered him  and said   thou  hypocrite  doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or  his  ass from the stall  and lead  him  away to watering  
16	and ought not this woman  being a daughter of abraham  whom satan hath bound  lo  these eighteen years  be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day  
17	and when he had said these things  all his adversaries were ashamed  and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him  
18 	then said he  unto what is the kingdom of god like  and whereunto shall i resemble it  
19	it is like a grain of mustard seed  which a man took  and cast into his garden  and it grew  and waxed a great tree  and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it  
20	and again he said  whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god  
21	it is like leaven  which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal  till the whole was leavened  
22	and he went through the cities and villages  teaching  and journeying toward jerusalem  
23 	then said one unto him  lord  are there few that be saved  and he said unto them  
24	strive to enter in at the strait gate  for many  i say unto you  will seek to enter in  and shall not be able  
25	when once the master of the house is risen up  and hath shut to the door  and ye begin to stand without  and to knock at the door  saying  lord  lord  open unto us  and he shall answer and say unto you  i know you not whence ye are  
26	then shall ye begin to say  we have eaten and drunk in thy presence  and thou hast taught in our streets  
27	but he shall say  i tell you  i know you not whence ye are  depart from me  all  ye  workers of iniquity  
28	there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  when ye shall see abraham  and isaac  and jacob  and all the prophets  in the kingdom of god  and you  yourselves  thrust out  
29	and they shall come from the east  and  from  the west  and from the north  and  from  the south  and shall sit down in the kingdom of god  
30	and  behold  there are last which shall be first  and there are first which shall be last  
31 	the same day there came certain of the pharisees  saying unto him  get thee out  and depart hence  for herod will kill thee  
32	and he said unto them  go ye  and tell that fox  behold  i cast out devils  and i do cures to day and to morrow  and the third  day  i shall be perfected  
33	nevertheless i must walk to day  and to morrow  and the  day  following  for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem  
34	o jerusalem  jerusalem  which killest the prophets  and stonest them that are sent unto thee  how often would i have gathered thy children together  as a hen  doth gather  her brood under  her  wings  and ye would not  
35	behold  your house is left unto you desolate  and verily i say unto you  ye shall not see me  until  the time  come when ye shall say  blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the lord  
luke 14
1 	and it came to pass  as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day  that they watched him  
2	and  behold  there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy  
3	and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees  saying  is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day  
4	and they held their peace  and he took  him   and healed him  and let him go  
5	and answered them  saying  which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit  and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day  
6	and they could not answer him again to these things  
7 	and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden  when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms  saying unto them  
8	when thou art bidden of any  man  to a wedding  sit not down in the highest room  lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him  
9	and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee  give this man place  and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room  
10	but when thou art bidden  go and sit down in the lowest room  that when he that bade thee cometh  he may say unto thee  friend  go up higher  then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee  
11	for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased  and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted  
12	then said he also to him that bade him  when thou makest a dinner or a supper  call not thy friends  nor thy brethren  neither thy kinsmen  nor  thy  rich neighbours  lest they also bid thee again  and a recompence be made thee  
13	but when thou makest a feast  call the poor  the maimed  the lame  the blind  
14	and thou shalt be blessed  for they cannot recompense thee  for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just  
15 	and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things  he said unto him  blessed  is  he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god  
16	then said he unto him  a certain man made a great supper  and bade many  
17	and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden  come  for all things are now ready  
18	and they all with one  consent  began to make excuse  the first said unto him  i have bought a piece of ground  and i must needs go and see it  i pray thee have me excused  
19	and another said  i have bought five yoke of oxen  and i go to prove them  i pray thee have me excused  
20	and another said  i have married a wife  and therefore i cannot come  
21	so that servant came  and shewed his lord these things  then the master of the house being angry said to his servant  go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city  and bring in hither the poor  and the maimed  and the halt  and the blind  
22	and the servant said  lord  it is done as thou hast commanded  and yet there is room  
23	and the lord said unto the servant  go out into the highways and hedges  and compel  them  to come in  that my house may be filled  
24	for i say unto you  that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper  
25 	and there went great multitudes with him  and he turned  and said unto them  
26	if any  man  come to me  and hate not his father  and mother  and wife  and children  and brethren  and sisters  yea  and his own life also  he cannot be my disciple  
27	and whosoever doth not bear his cross  and come after me  cannot be my disciple  
28	for which of you  intending to build a tower  sitteth not down first  and counteth the cost  whether he have  sufficient  to finish  it   
29	lest haply  after he hath laid the foundation  and is not able to finish  it   all that behold  it  begin to mock him  
30	saying  this man began to build  and was not able to finish  
31	or what king  going to make war against another king  sitteth not down first  and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand  
32	or else  while the other is yet a great way off  he sendeth an ambassage  and desireth conditions of peace  
33	so likewise  whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath  he cannot be my disciple  
34	salt  is  good  but if the salt have lost his savour  wherewith shall it be seasoned  
35	it is neither fit for the land  nor yet for the dunghill   but  men cast it out  he that hath ears to hear  let him hear  
luke 15
1 	then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him  
2	and the pharisees and scribes murmured  saying  this man receiveth sinners  and eateth with them  
3	and he spake this parable unto them  saying  
4	what man of you  having an hundred sheep  if he lose one of them  doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness  and go after that which is lost  until he find it  
5	and when he hath found  it   he layeth  it  on his shoulders  rejoicing  
6	and when he cometh home  he calleth together  his  friends and neighbours  saying unto them  rejoice with me  for i have found my sheep which was lost  
7	i say unto you  that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth  more than over ninety and nine just persons  which need no repentance  
8	either what woman having ten pieces of silver  if she lose one piece  doth not light a candle  and sweep the house  and seek diligently till she find  it   
9	and when she hath found  it   she calleth  her  friends and  her  neighbours together  saying  rejoice with me  for i have found the piece which i had lost  
10	likewise  i say unto you  there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth  
11 	and he said  a certain man had two sons  
12	and the younger of them said to  his  father  father  give me the portion of goods that falleth  to me   and he divided unto them  his  living  
13	and not many days after the younger son gathered all together  and took his journey into a far country  and there wasted his substance with riotous living  
14	and when he had spent all  there arose a mighty famine in that land  and he began to be in want  
15	and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country  and he sent him into his fields to feed swine  
16	and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat  and no man gave unto him  
17	and when he came to himself  he said  how many hired servants of my father s have bread enough and to spare  and i perish with hunger  
18	i will arise and go to my father  and will say unto him  father  i have sinned against heaven  and before thee  
19	and am no more worthy to be called thy son  make me as one of thy hired servants  
20	and he arose  and came to his father  but when he was yet a great way off  his father saw him  and had compassion  and ran  and fell on his neck  and kissed him  
21	and the son said unto him  father  i have sinned against heaven  and in thy sight  and am no more worthy to be called thy son  
22	but the father said to his servants  bring forth the best robe  and put  it  on him  and put a ring on his hand  and shoes on  his  feet  
23	and bring hither the fatted calf  and kill  it   and let us eat  and be merry  
24	for this my son was dead  and is alive again  he was lost  and is found  and they began to be merry  
25	now his elder son was in the field  and as he came and drew nigh to the house  he heard musick and dancing  
26	and he called one of the servants  and asked what these things meant  
27	and he said unto him  thy brother is come  and thy father hath killed the fatted calf  because he hath received him safe and sound  
28	and he was angry  and would not go in  therefore came his father out  and intreated him  
29	and he answering said to  his  father  lo  these many years do i serve thee  neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment  and yet thou never gavest me a kid  that i might make merry with my friends  
30	but as soon as this thy son was come  which hath devoured thy living with harlots  thou hast killed for him the fatted calf  
31	and he said unto him  son  thou art ever with me  and all that i have is thine  
32	it was meet that we should make merry  and be glad  for this thy brother was dead  and is alive again  and was lost  and is found  
luke 16
1 	and he said also unto his disciples  there was a certain rich man  which had a steward  and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods  
2	and he called him  and said unto him  how is it that i hear this of thee  give an account of thy stewardship  for thou mayest be no longer steward  
3	then the steward said within himself  what shall i do  for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship  i cannot dig  to beg i am ashamed  
4	i am resolved what to do  that  when i am put out of the stewardship  they may receive me into their houses  
5	so he called every one of his lord s debtors  unto him   and said unto the first  how much owest thou unto my lord  
6	and he said  an hundred measures of oil  and he said unto him  take thy bill  and sit down quickly  and write fifty  
7	then said he to another  and how much owest thou  and he said  an hundred measures of wheat  and he said unto him  take thy bill  and write fourscore  
8	and the lord commended the unjust steward  because he had done wisely  for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light  
9	and i say unto you  make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness  that  when ye fail  they may receive you into everlasting habitations  
10	he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much  
11	if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon  who will commit to your trust the true  riches   
12	and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man s  who shall give you that which is your own  
13	no servant can serve two masters  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or else he will hold to the one  and despise the other  ye cannot serve god and mammon  
14	and the pharisees also  who were covetous  heard all these things  and they derided him  
15	and he said unto them  ye are they which justify yourselves before men  but god knoweth your hearts  for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god  
16	the law and the prophets  were  until john  since that time the kingdom of god is preached  and every man presseth into it  
17	and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass  than one tittle of the law to fail  
18	whosoever putteth away his wife  and marrieth another  committeth adultery  and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from  her  husband committeth adultery  
19 	there was a certain rich man  which was clothed in purple and fine linen  and fared sumptuously every day  
20	and there was a certain beggar named lazarus  which was laid at his gate  full of sores  
21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man s table  moreover the dogs came and licked his sores  
22	and it came to pass  that the beggar died  and was carried by the angels into abraham s bosom  the rich man also died  and was buried  
23	and in hell he lift up his eyes  being in torments  and seeth abraham afar off  and lazarus in his bosom  
24	and he cried and said  father abraham  have mercy on me  and send lazarus  that he may dip the tip of his finger in water  and cool my tongue  for i am tormented in this flame  
25	but abraham said  son  remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things  and likewise lazarus evil things  but now he is comforted  and thou art tormented  
26	and beside all this  between us and you there is a great gulf fixed  so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot  neither can they pass to us  that  would come  from thence  
27	then he said  i pray thee therefore  father  that thou wouldest send him to my father s house  
28	for i have five brethren  that he may testify unto them  lest they also come into this place of torment  
29	abraham saith unto him  they have moses and the prophets  let them hear them  
30	and he said  nay  father abraham  but if one went unto them from the dead  they will repent  
31	and he said unto him  if they hear not moses and the prophets  neither will they be persuaded  though one rose from the dead  
luke 17
1 	then said he unto the disciples  it is impossible but that offences will come  but woe  unto him   through whom they come  
2	it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and he cast into the sea  than that he should offend one of these little ones  
3	take heed to yourselves  if thy brother trespass against thee  rebuke him  and if he repent  forgive him  
4	and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day  and seven times in a day turn again to thee  saying  i repent  thou shalt forgive him  
5	and the apostles said unto the lord  increase our faith  
6	and the lord said  if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed  ye might say unto this sycamine tree  be thou plucked up by the root  and be thou planted in the sea  and it should obey you  
7	but which of you  having a servant plowing or feeding cattle  will say unto him by and by  when he is come from the field  go and sit down to meat  
8	and will not rather say unto him  make ready wherewith i may sup  and gird thyself  and serve me  till i have eaten and drunken  and afterward thou shalt eat and drink  
9	doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him  i trow not  
10	so likewise ye  when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you  say  we are unprofitable servants  we have done that which was our duty to do  
11 	and it came to pass  as he went to jerusalem  that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee  
12	and as he entered into a certain village  there met him ten men that were lepers  which stood afar off  
13	and they lifted up  their  voices  and said  jesus  master  have mercy on us  
14	and when he saw  them   he said unto them  go shew yourselves unto the priests  and it came to pass  that  as they went  they were cleansed  
15	and one of them  when he saw that he was healed  turned back  and with a loud voice glorified god  
16	and fell down on  his  face at his feet  giving him thanks  and he was a samaritan  
17	and jesus answering said  were there not ten cleansed  but where  are  the nine  
18	there are not found that returned to give glory to god  save this stranger  
19	and he said unto him  arise  go thy way  thy faith hath made thee whole  
20 	and when he was demanded of the pharisees  when the kingdom of god should come  he answered them and said  the kingdom of god cometh not with observation  
21	neither shall they say  lo here  or  lo there  for  behold  the kingdom of god is within you  
22	and he said unto the disciples  the days will come  when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man  and ye shall not see  it   
23	and they shall say to you  see here  or  see there  go not after  them   nor follow  them   
24	for as the lightning  that lighteneth out of the one  part  under heaven  shineth unto the other  part  under heaven  so shall also the son of man be in his day  
25	but first must he suffer many things  and be rejected of this generation  
26	and as it was in the days of noe  so shall it be also in the days of the son of man  
27	they did eat  they drank  they married wives  they were given in marriage  until the day that noe entered into the ark  and the flood came  and destroyed them all  
28	likewise also as it was in the days of lot  they did eat  they drank  they bought  they sold  they planted  they builded  
29	but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven  and destroyed  them  all  
30	even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed  
31	in that day  he which shall be upon the housetop  and his stuff in the house  let him not come down to take it away  and he that is in the field  let him likewise not return back  
32	remember lot s wife  
33	whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it  and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it  
34	i tell you  in that night there shall be two  men  in one bed  the one shall be taken  and the other shall be left  
35	two  women  shall be grinding together  the one shall be taken  and the other left  
36	two  men  shall be in the field  the one shall be taken  and the other left  
37	and they answered and said unto him  where  lord  and he said unto them  wheresoever the body  is   thither will the eagles be gathered together  
luke 18
1 	and he spake a parable unto them  to this end   that men ought always to pray  and not to faint  
2	saying  there was in a city a judge  which feared not god  neither regarded man  
3	and there was a widow in that city  and she came unto him  saying  avenge me of mine adversary  
4	and he would not for a while  but afterward he said within himself  though i fear not god  nor regard man  
5	yet because this widow troubleth me  i will avenge her  lest by her continual coming she weary me  
6	and the lord said  hear what the unjust judge saith  
7	and shall not god avenge his own elect  which cry day and night unto him  though he bear long with them  
8	i tell you that he will avenge them speedily  nevertheless when the son of man cometh  shall he find faith on the earth  
9 	and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous  and despised others  
10	two men went up into the temple to pray  the one a pharisee  and the other a publican  
11	the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself  god  i thank thee  that i am not as other men  are   extortioners  unjust  adulterers  or even as this publican  
12	i fast twice in the week  i give tithes of all that i possess  
13	and the publican  standing afar off  would not lift up so much as  his  eyes unto heaven  but smote upon his breast  saying  god be merciful to me a sinner  
14	i tell you  this man went down to his house justified  rather  than the other  for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased  and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted  
15 	and they brought unto him also infants  that he would touch them  but when  his  disciples saw  it   they rebuked them  
16	but jesus called them  unto him   and said  suffer little children to come unto me  and forbid them not  for of such is the kingdom of god  
17	verily i say unto you  whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein  
18 	and a certain ruler asked him  saying  good master  what shall i do to inherit eternal life  
19	and jesus said unto him  why callest thou me good  none  is  good  save one   that is   god  
20	thou knowest the commandments  do not commit adultery  do not kill  do not steal  do not bear false witness  honour thy father and thy mother  
21	and he said  all these have i kept from my youth up  
22	now when jesus heard these things  he said unto him  yet lackest thou one thing  sell all that thou hast  and distribute unto the poor  and thou shalt have treasure in heaven  and come  follow me  
23	and when he heard this  he was very sorrowful  for he was very rich  
24	and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful  he said  how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god  
25	for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle s eye  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  
26	and they that heard  it  said  who then can be saved  
27	and he said  the things which are impossible with men are possible with god  
28	then peter said  lo  we have left all  and followed thee  
29	and he said unto them  verily i say unto you  there is no man that hath left house  or parents  or brethren  or wife  or children  for the kingdom of god s sake  
30	who shall not receive manifold more in this present time  and in the world to come life everlasting  
31 	then he took  unto him  the twelve  and said unto them  behold  we go up to jerusalem  and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished  
32	for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles  and shall be mocked  and spitefully entreated  and spitted on  
33	and they shall scourge  him   and put him to death  and the third day he shall rise again  
34	and they understood none of these things  and this saying was hid from them  neither knew they the things which were spoken  
35 	and it came to pass  that as he was come nigh unto jericho  a certain blind man sat by the way side begging  
36	and hearing the multitude pass by  he asked what it meant  
37	and they told him  that jesus of nazareth passeth by  
38	and he cried  saying  jesus   thou  son of david  have mercy on me  
39	and they which went before rebuked him  that he should hold his peace  but he cried so much the more   thou  son of david  have mercy on me  
40	and jesus stood  and commanded him to be brought unto him  and when he was come near  he asked him  
41	saying  what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee  and he said  lord  that i may receive my sight  
42	and jesus said unto him  receive thy sight  thy faith hath saved thee  
43	and immediately he received his sight  and followed him  glorifying god  and all the people  when they saw  it   gave praise unto god  
luke 19
1 	and  jesus  entered and passed through jericho  
2	and  behold   there was  a man named zacchaeus  which was the chief among the publicans  and he was rich  
3	and he sought to see jesus who he was  and could not for the press  because he was little of stature  
4	and he ran before  and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him  for he was to pass that  way   
5	and when jesus came to the place  he looked up  and saw him  and said unto him  zacchaeus  make haste  and come down  for to day i must abide at thy house  
6	and he made haste  and came down  and received him joyfully  
7	and when they saw  it   they all murmured  saying  that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner  
8	and zacchaeus stood  and said unto the lord  behold  lord  the half of my goods i give to the poor  and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation  i restore  him  fourfold  
9	and jesus said unto him  this day is salvation come to this house  forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham  
10	for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  
11 	and as they heard these things  he added and spake a parable  because he was nigh to jerusalem  and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear  
12	he said therefore  a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom  and to return  
13	and he called his ten servants  and delivered them ten pounds  and said unto them  occupy till i come  
14	but his citizens hated him  and sent a message after him  saying  we will not have this  man  to reign over us  
15	and it came to pass  that when he was returned  having received the kingdom  then he commanded these servants to be called unto him  to whom he had given the money  that he might know how much every man had gained by trading  
16	then came the first  saying  lord  thy pound hath gained ten pounds  
17	and he said unto him  well  thou good servant  because thou hast been faithful in a very little  have thou authority over ten cities  
18	and the second came  saying  lord  thy pound hath gained five pounds  
19	and he said likewise to him  be thou also over five cities  
20	and another came  saying  lord  behold   here is  thy pound  which i have kept laid up in a napkin  
21	for i feared thee  because thou art an austere man  thou takest up that thou layedst not down  and reapest that thou didst not sow  
22	and he saith unto him  out of thine own mouth will i judge thee   thou  wicked servant  thou knewest that i was an austere man  taking up that i laid not down  and reaping that i did not sow  
23	wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank  that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury  
24	and he said unto them that stood by  take from him the pound  and give  it  to him that hath ten pounds  
25	 and they said unto him  lord  he hath ten pounds   
26	for i say unto you  that unto every one which hath shall be given  and from him that hath not  even that he hath shall be taken away from him  
27	but those mine enemies  which would not that i should reign over them  bring hither  and slay  them  before me  
28 	and when he had thus spoken  he went before  ascending up to jerusalem  
29	and it came to pass  when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany  at the mount called  the mount  of olives  he sent two of his disciples  
30	saying  go ye into the village over against  you   in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied  whereon yet never man sat  loose him  and bring  him hither   
31	and if any man ask you  why do ye loose  him   thus shall ye say unto him  because the lord hath need of him  
32	and they that were sent went their way  and found even as he had said unto them  
33	and as they were loosing the colt  the owners thereof said unto them  why loose ye the colt  
34	and they said  the lord hath need of him  
35	and they brought him to jesus  and they cast their garments upon the colt  and they set jesus thereon  
36	and as he went  they spread their clothes in the way  
37	and when he was come nigh  even now at the descent of the mount of olives  the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen  
38	saying  blessed  be  the king that cometh in the name of the lord  peace in heaven  and glory in the highest  
39	and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him  master  rebuke thy disciples  
40	and he answered and said unto them  i tell you that  if these should hold their peace  the stones would immediately cry out  
41 	and when he was come near  he beheld the city  and wept over it  
42	saying  if thou hadst known  even thou  at least in this thy day  the things  which belong  unto thy peace  but now they are hid from thine eyes  
43	for the days shall come upon thee  that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee  and compass thee round  and keep thee in on every side  
44	and shall lay thee even with the ground  and thy children within thee  and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another  because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation  
45	and he went into the temple  and began to cast out them that sold therein  and them that bought  
46	saying unto them  it is written  my house is the house of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thieves  
47	and he taught daily in the temple  but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him  
48	and could not find what they might do  for all the people were very attentive to hear him  
luke 20
1 	and it came to pass   that  on one of those days  as he taught the people in the temple  and preached the gospel  the chief priests and the scribes came upon  him  with the elders  
2	and spake unto him  saying  tell us  by what authority doest thou these things  or who is he that gave thee this authority  
3	and he answered and said unto them  i will also ask you one thing  and answer me  
4	the baptism of john  was it from heaven  or of men  
5	and they reasoned with themselves  saying  if we shall say  from heaven  he will say  why then believed ye him not  
6	but and if we say  of men  all the people will stone us  for they be persuaded that john was a prophet  
7	and they answered  that they could not tell whence  it was   
8	and jesus said unto them  neither tell i you by what authority i do these things  
9 	then began he to speak to the people this parable  a certain man planted a vineyard  and let it forth to husbandmen  and went into a far country for a long time  
10	and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen  that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard  but the husbandmen beat him  and sent  him  away empty  
11	and again he sent another servant  and they beat him also  and entreated  him  shamefully  and sent  him  away empty  
12	and again he sent a third  and they wounded him also  and cast  him  out  
13	then said the lord of the vineyard  what shall i do  i will send my beloved son  it may be they will reverence  him  when they see him  
14	but when the husbandmen saw him  they reasoned among themselves  saying  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  that the inheritance may be ours  
15	so they cast him out of the vineyard  and killed  him   what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them  
16	he shall come and destroy these husbandmen  and shall give the vineyard to others  and when they heard  it   they said  god forbid  
17	and he beheld them  and said  what is this then that is written  the stone which the builders rejected  the same is become the head of the corner  
18	whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken  but on whomsoever it shall fall  it will grind him to powder  
19	and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him  and they feared the people  for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them  
20 	and they watched  him   and sent forth spies  which should feign themselves just men  that they might take hold of his words  that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor  
21	and they asked him  saying  master  we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly  neither acceptest thou the person  of any   but teachest the way of god truly  
22	is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar  or no  
23	but he perceived their craftiness  and said unto them  why tempt ye me  
24	shew me a penny  whose image and superscription hath it  they answered and said  caesar s  
25	and he said unto them  render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar s  and unto god the things which be god s  
26	and they could not take hold of his words before the people  and they marvelled at his answer  and held their peace  
27 	then came to  him  certain of the sadducees  which deny that there is any resurrection  and they asked him  
28	saying  master  moses wrote unto us  if any man s brother die  having a wife  and he die without children  that his brother should take his wife  and raise up seed unto his brother  
29	there were therefore seven brethren  and the first took a wife  and died without children  
30	and the second took her to wife  and he died childless  
31	and the third took her  and in like manner the seven also  and they left no children  and died  
32	last of all the woman died also  
33	therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she  for seven had her to wife  
34	and jesus answering said unto them  the children of this world marry  and are given in marriage  
35	but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world  and the resurrection from the dead  neither marry  nor are given in marriage  
36	neither can they die any more  for they are equal unto the angels  and are the children of god  being the children of the resurrection  
37	now that the dead are raised  even moses shewed at the bush  when he calleth the lord the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  
38	for he is not a god of the dead  but of the living  for all live unto him  
39 	then certain of the scribes answering said  master  thou hast well said  
40	and after that they durst not ask him any  question at all   
41	and he said unto them  how say they that christ is david s son  
42	and david himself saith in the book of psalms  the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  
43	till i make thine enemies thy footstool  
44	david therefore calleth him lord  how is he then his son  
45	then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples  
46	beware of the scribes  which desire to walk in long robes  and love greetings in the markets  and the highest seats in the synagogues  and the chief rooms at feasts  
47	which devour widows  houses  and for a shew make long prayers  the same shall receive greater damnation  
luke 21
1 	and he looked up  and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury  
2	and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites  
3	and he said  of a truth i say unto you  that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all  
4	for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god  but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had  
5 	and as some spake of the temple  how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts  he said  
6	 as for  these things which ye behold  the days will come  in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another  that shall not be thrown down  
7	and they asked him  saying  master  but when shall these things be  and what sign  will there be  when these things shall come to pass  
8	and he said  take heed that ye be not deceived  for many shall come in my name  saying  i am  christ   and the time draweth near  go ye not therefore after them  
9	but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions  be not terrified  for these things must first come to pass  but the end  is  not by and by  
10	then said he unto them  nation shall rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  
11	and great earthquakes shall be in divers places  and famines  and pestilences  and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven  
12	but before all these  they shall lay their hands on you  and persecute  you   delivering  you  up to the synagogues  and into prisons  being brought before kings and rulers for my name s sake  
13	and it shall turn to you for a testimony  
14	settle  it  therefore in your hearts  not to meditate before what ye shall answer  
15	for i will give you a mouth and wisdom  which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist  
16	and ye shall be betrayed both by parents  and brethren  and kinsfolks  and friends  and  some  of you shall they cause to be put to death  
17	and ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name s sake  
18	but there shall not an hair of your head perish  
19	in your patience possess ye your souls  
20 	and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies  then know that the desolation thereof is nigh  
21	then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains  and let them which are in the midst of it depart out  and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto  
22	for these be the days of vengeance  that all things which are written may be fulfilled  
23	but woe unto them that are with child  and to them that give suck  in those days  for there shall be great distress in the land  and wrath upon this people  
24	and they shall fall by the edge of the sword  and shall be led away captive into all nations  and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles  until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled  
25	and there shall be signs in the sun  and in the moon  and in the stars  and upon the earth distress of nations  with perplexity  the sea and the waves roaring  
26	men s hearts failing them for fear  and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth  for the powers of heaven shall be shaken  
27	and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory  
28	and when these things begin to come to pass  then look up  and lift up your heads  for your redemption draweth nigh  
29 	and he spake to them a parable  behold the fig tree  and all the trees  
30	when they now shoot forth  ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand  
31	so likewise ye  when ye see these things come to pass  know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand  
32	verily i say unto you  this generation shall not pass away  till all be fulfilled  
33	heaven and earth shall pass away  but my words shall not pass away  
34	and take heed to yourselves  lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting  and drunkenness  and cares of this life  and  so  that day come upon you unawares  
35	for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth  
36	watch ye therefore  and pray always  that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass  and to stand before the son of man  
37	and in the day time he was teaching in the temple  and at night he went out  and abode in the mount that is called  the mount  of olives  
38	and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple  for to hear him  
luke 22
1 	now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh  which is called the passover  
2	and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him  for they feared the people  
3	then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot  being of the number of the twelve  
4	and he went his way  and communed with the chief priests and captains  how he might betray him unto them  
5	and they were glad  and covenanted to give him money  
6	and he promised  and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude  
7 	then came the day of unleavened bread  when the passover must be killed  
8	and he sent peter and john  saying  go and prepare us the passover  that we may eat  
9	and they said unto him  where wilt thou that we prepare  
10	and he said unto them  behold  when ye are entered into the city  there shall a man meet you  bearing a pitcher of water  follow him into the house where he entereth in  
11	and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house  the master saith unto thee  where is the guestchamber  where i shall eat the passover with my disciples  
12	and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished  there make ready  
13	and they went  and found as he had said unto them  and they made ready the passover  
14	and when the hour was come  he sat down  and the twelve apostles with him  
15	and he said unto them  with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer  
16	for i say unto you  i will not any more eat thereof  until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god  
17	and he took the cup  and gave thanks  and said  take this  and divide  it  among yourselves  
18	for i say unto you  i will not drink of the fruit of the vine  until the kingdom of god shall come  
19	and he took bread  and gave thanks  and brake  it   and gave unto them  saying  this is my body which is given for you  this do in remembrance of me  
20	likewise also the cup after supper  saying  this cup  is  the new testament in my blood  which is shed for you  
21 	but  behold  the hand of him that betrayeth me  is  with me on the table  
22	and truly the son of man goeth  as it was determined  but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed  
23	and they began to enquire among themselves  which of them it was that should do this thing  
24	and there was also a strife among them  which of them should be accounted the greatest  
25	and he said unto them  the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them  and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors  
26	but ye  shall  not  be  so  but he that is greatest among you  let him be as the younger  and he that is chief  as he that doth serve  
27	for whether  is  greater  he that sitteth at meat  or he that serveth   is  not he that sitteth at meat  but i am among you as he that serveth  
28	ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations  
29	and i appoint unto you a kingdom  as my father hath appointed unto me  
30	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom  and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel  
31	and the lord said  simon  simon  behold  satan hath desired  to have  you  that he may sift  you  as wheat  
32	but i have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not  and when thou art converted  strengthen thy brethren  
33	and he said unto him  lord  i am ready to go with thee  both into prison  and to death  
34	and he said  i tell thee  peter  the cock shall not crow this day  before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me  
35	and he said unto them  when i sent you without purse  and scrip  and shoes  lacked ye any thing  and they said  nothing  
36	then said he unto them  but now  he that hath a purse  let him take  it   and likewise  his  scrip  and he that hath no sword  let him sell his garment  and buy one  
37	for i say unto you  that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me  and he was reckoned among the transgressors  for the things concerning me have an end  
38	and they said  lord  behold  here  are  two swords  and he said unto them  it is enough  
39 	and he came out  and went  as he was wont  to the mount of olives  and his disciples also followed him  
40	and when he was at the place  he said unto them  pray that ye enter not into temptation  
41	and he was withdrawn from them about a stone s cast  and kneeled down  and prayed  
42	saying  father  if thou be willing  remove this cup from me  nevertheless not my will  but thine  be done  
43	and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven  strengthening him  
44	and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly  and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground  
45	and when he rose up from prayer  and was come to his disciples  he found them sleeping for sorrow  
46	and said unto them  why sleep ye  rise and pray  lest ye enter into temptation  
47 	and while he yet spake  behold a multitude  and he that was called judas  one of the twelve  went before them  and drew near unto jesus to kiss him  
48	but jesus said unto him  judas  betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss  
49	when they which were about him saw what would follow  they said unto him  lord  shall we smite with the sword  
50	and one of them smote the servant of the high priest  and cut off his right ear  
51	and jesus answered and said  suffer ye thus far  and he touched his ear  and healed him  
52	then jesus said unto the chief priests  and captains of the temple  and the elders  which were come to him  be ye come out  as against a thief  with swords and staves  
53	when i was daily with you in the temple  ye stretched forth no hands against me  but this is your hour  and the power of darkness  
54 	then took they him  and led  him   and brought him into the high priest s house  and peter followed afar off  
55	and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall  and were set down together  peter sat down among them  
56	but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire  and earnestly looked upon him  and said  this man was also with him  
57	and he denied him  saying  woman  i know him not  
58	and after a little while another saw him  and said  thou art also of them  and peter said  man  i am not  
59	and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed  saying  of a truth this  fellow  also was with him  for he is a galilaean  
60	and peter said  man  i know not what thou sayest  and immediately  while he yet spake  the cock crew  
61	and the lord turned  and looked upon peter  and peter remembered the word of the lord  how he had said unto him  before the cock crow  thou shalt deny me thrice  
62	and peter went out  and wept bitterly  
63 	and the men that held jesus mocked him  and smote  him   
64	and when they had blindfolded him  they struck him on the face  and asked him  saying  prophesy  who is it that smote thee  
65	and many other things blasphemously spake they against him  
66	and as soon as it was day  the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together  and led him into their council  saying  
67	art thou the christ  tell us  and he said unto them  if i tell you  ye will not believe  
68	and if i also ask  you   ye will not answer me  nor let  me  go  
69	hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god  
70	then said they all  art thou then the son of god  and he said unto them  ye say that i am  
71	and they said  what need we any further witness  for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth  
luke 23
1 	and the whole multitude of them arose  and led him unto pilate  
2	and they began to accuse him  saying  we found this  fellow  perverting the nation  and forbidding to give tribute to caesar  saying that he himself is christ a king  
3	and pilate asked him  saying  art thou the king of the jews  and he answered him and said  thou sayest  it   
4	then said pilate to the chief priests and  to  the people  i find no fault in this man  
5	and they were the more fierce  saying  he stirreth up the people  teaching throughout all jewry  beginning from galilee to this place  
6	when pilate heard of galilee  he asked whether the man were a galilaean  
7	and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod s jurisdiction  he sent him to herod  who himself also was at jerusalem at that time  
8	and when herod saw jesus  he was exceeding glad  for he was desirous to see him of a long  season   because he had heard many things of him  and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him  
9	then he questioned with him in many words  but he answered him nothing  
10	and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him  
11	and herod with his men of war set him at nought  and mocked  him   and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe  and sent him again to pilate  
12	and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together  for before they were at enmity between themselves  
13 	and pilate  when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people  
14	said unto them  ye have brought this man unto me  as one that perverteth the people  and  behold  i  having examined  him  before you  have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him  
15	no  nor yet herod  for i sent you to him  and  lo  nothing worthy of death is done unto him  
16	i will therefore chastise him  and release  him   
17	 for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast   
18	and they cried out all at once  saying  away with this  man   and release unto us barabbas  
19	 who for a certain sedition made in the city  and for murder  was cast into prison   
20	pilate therefore  willing to release jesus  spake again to them  
21	but they cried  saying  crucify  him   crucify him  
22	and he said unto them the third time  why  what evil hath he done  i have found no cause of death in him  i will therefore chastise him  and let  him  go  
23	and they were instant with loud voices  requiring that he might be crucified  and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed  
24	and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required  
25	and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison  whom they had desired  but he delivered jesus to their will  
26 	and as they led him away  they laid hold upon one simon  a cyrenian  coming out of the country  and on him they laid the cross  that he might bear  it  after jesus  
27	and there followed him a great company of people  and of women  which also bewailed and lamented him  
28	but jesus turning unto them said  daughters of jerusalem  weep not for me  but weep for yourselves  and for your children  
29	for  behold  the days are coming  in the which they shall say  blessed  are  the barren  and the wombs that never bare  and the paps which never gave suck  
30	then shall they begin to say to the mountains  fall on us  and to the hills  cover us  
31	for if they do these things in a green tree  what shall be done in the dry  
32 	and there were also two other  malefactors  led with him to be put to death  
33	and when they were come to the place  which is called calvary  there they crucified him  and the malefactors  one on the right hand  and the other on the left  
34	then said jesus  father  forgive them  for they know not what they do  and they parted his raiment  and cast lots  
35	and the people stood beholding  and the rulers also with them derided  him   saying  he saved others  let him save himself  if he be christ  the chosen of god  
36	and the soldiers also mocked him  coming to him  and offering him vinegar  
37	and saying  if thou be the king of the jews  save thyself  
38	and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek  and latin  and hebrew  this is the king of the jews  
39	and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him  saying  if thou be christ  save thyself and us  
40	but the other answering rebuked him  saying  dost not thou fear god  seeing thou art in the same condemnation  
41	and we indeed justly  for we receive the due reward of our deeds  but this man hath done nothing amiss  
42	and he said unto jesus  lord  remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom  
43	and jesus said unto him  verily i say unto thee  to day shalt thou be with me in paradise  
44 	and it was about the sixth hour  and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour  
45	and the sun was darkened  and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst  
46	and when jesus had cried with a loud voice  he said  father  into thy hands i commend my spirit  and having said thus  he gave up the ghost  
47	now when the centurion saw what was done  he glorified god  saying  certainly this was a righteous man  
48	and all the people that came together to that sight  beholding the things which were done  smote their breasts  and returned  
49	and all his acquaintance  and the women that followed him from galilee  stood afar off  beholding these things  
50 	and  behold   there was  a man named joseph  a counsellor   and he was  a good man  and a just  
51	 the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them    he was  of arimathaea  a city of the jews  who also himself waited for the kingdom of god  
52	this  man  went unto pilate  and begged the body of jesus  
53	and he took it down  and wrapped it in linen  and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone  wherein never man before was laid  
54	and that day was the preparation  and the sabbath drew on  
55	and the women also  which came with him from galilee  followed after  and beheld the sepulchre  and how his body was laid  
56	and they returned  and prepared spices and ointments  and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment  
luke 24
1 	now upon the first  day  of the week  very early in the morning  they came unto the sepulchre  bringing the spices which they had prepared  and certain  others  with them  
2	and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre  
3	and they entered in  and found not the body of the lord jesus  
4	and it came to pass  as they were much perplexed thereabout  behold  two men stood by them in shining garments  
5	and as they were afraid  and bowed down  their  faces to the earth  they said unto them  why seek ye the living among the dead  
6	he is not here  but is risen  remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee  
7	saying  the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men  and be crucified  and the third day rise again  
8	and they remembered his words  
9	and returned from the sepulchre  and told all these things unto the eleven  and to all the rest  
10	it was mary magdalene  and joanna  and mary  the mother  of james  and other  women that were  with them  which told these things unto the apostles  
11	and their words seemed to them as idle tales  and they believed them not  
12	then arose peter  and ran unto the sepulchre  and stooping down  he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves  and departed  wondering in himself at that which was come to pass  
13 	and  behold  two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus  which was from jerusalem  about  threescore furlongs  
14	and they talked together of all these things which had happened  
15	and it came to pass  that  while they communed  together  and reasoned  jesus himself drew near  and went with them  
16	but their eyes were holden that they should not know him  
17	and he said unto them  what manner of communications  are  these that ye have one to another  as ye walk  and are sad  
18	and the one of them  whose name was cleopas  answering said unto him  art thou only a stranger in jerusalem  and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days  
19	and he said unto them  what things  and they said unto him  concerning jesus of nazareth  which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people  
20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death  and have crucified him  
21	but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel  and beside all this  to day is the third day since these things were done  
22	yea  and certain women also of our company made us astonished  which were early at the sepulchre  
23	and when they found not his body  they came  saying  that they had also seen a vision of angels  which said that he was alive  
24	and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre  and found  it  even so as the women had said  but him they saw not  
25	then he said unto them  o fools  and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken  
26	ought not christ to have suffered these things  and to enter into his glory  
27	and beginning at moses and all the prophets  he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself  
28	and they drew nigh unto the village  whither they went  and he made as though he would have gone further  
29	but they constrained him  saying  abide with us  for it is toward evening  and the day is far spent  and he went in to tarry with them  
30	and it came to pass  as he sat at meat with them  he took bread  and blessed  it   and brake  and gave to them  
31	and their eyes were opened  and they knew him  and he vanished out of their sight  
32	and they said one to another  did not our heart burn within us  while he talked with us by the way  and while he opened to us the scriptures  
33	and they rose up the same hour  and returned to jerusalem  and found the eleven gathered together  and them that were with them  
34	saying  the lord is risen indeed  and hath appeared to simon  
35	and they told what things  were done  in the way  and how he was known of them in breaking of bread  
36 	and as they thus spake  jesus himself stood in the midst of them  and saith unto them  peace  be  unto you  
37	but they were terrified and affrighted  and supposed that they had seen a spirit  
38	and he said unto them  why are ye troubled  and why do thoughts arise in your hearts  
39	behold my hands and my feet  that it is i myself  handle me  and see  for a spirit hath not flesh and bones  as ye see me have  
40	and when he had thus spoken  he shewed them  his  hands and  his  feet  
41	and while they yet believed not for joy  and wondered  he said unto them  have ye here any meat  
42	and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish  and of an honeycomb  
43	and he took  it   and did eat before them  
44	and he said unto them  these  are  the words which i spake unto you  while i was yet with you  that all things must be fulfilled  which were written in the law of moses  and  in  the prophets  and  in  the psalms  concerning me  
45	then opened he their understanding  that they might understand the scriptures  
46	and said unto them  thus it is written  and thus it behoved christ to suffer  and to rise from the dead the third day  
47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations  beginning at jerusalem  
48	and ye are witnesses of these things  
49	and  behold  i send the promise of my father upon you  but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem  until ye be endued with power from on high  
50 	and he led them out as far as to bethany  and he lifted up his hands  and blessed them  
51	and it came to pass  while he blessed them  he was parted from them  and carried up into heaven  
52	and they worshipped him  and returned to jerusalem with great joy  
53	and were continually in the temple  praising and blessing god  amen  

john
john 1
1 	in the beginning was the word  and the word was with god  and the word was god  
2	the same was in the beginning with god  
3	all things were made by him  and without him was not any thing made that was made  
4	in him was life  and the life was the light of men  
5 	and the light shineth in darkness  and the darkness comprehended it not  
6	there was a man sent from god  whose name  was  john  
7	the same came for a witness  to bear witness of the light  that all  men  through him might believe  
8	he was not that light  but  was sent  to bear witness of that light  
9	 that  was the true light  which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  
10	he was in the world  and the world was made by him  and the world knew him not  
11	he came unto his own  and his own received him not  
12	but as many as received him  to them gave he power to become the sons of god   even  to them that believe on his name  
13	which were born  not of blood  nor of the will of the flesh  nor of the will of man  but of god  
14	and the word was made flesh  and dwelt among us   and we beheld his glory  the glory as of the only begotten of the father   full of grace and truth  
15 	john bare witness of him  and cried  saying  this was he of whom i spake  he that cometh after me is preferred before me  for he was before me  
16	and of his fulness have all we received  and grace for grace  
17	for the law was given by moses   but  grace and truth came by jesus christ  
18	no man hath seen god at any time  the only begotten son  which is in the bosom of the father  he hath declared  him   
19 	and this is the record of john  when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him  who art thou  
20	and he confessed  and denied not  but confessed  i am not the christ  
21	and they asked him  what then  art thou elias  and he saith  i am not  art thou that prophet  and he answered  no  
22	then said they unto him  who art thou  that we may give an answer to them that sent us  what sayest thou of thyself  
23	he said  i  am  the voice of one crying in the wilderness  make straight the way of the lord  as said the prophet esaias  
24	and they which were sent were of the pharisees  
25	and they asked him  and said unto him  why baptizest thou then  if thou be not that christ  nor elias  neither that prophet  
26	john answered them  saying  i baptize with water  but there standeth one among you  whom ye know not  
27	he it is  who coming after me is preferred before me  whose shoe s latchet i am not worthy to unloose  
28	these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan  where john was baptizing  
29 	the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him  and saith  behold the lamb of god  which taketh away the sin of the world  
30	this is he of whom i said  after me cometh a man which is preferred before me  for he was before me  
31	and i knew him not  but that he should be made manifest to israel  therefore am i come baptizing with water  
32	and john bare record  saying  i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove  and it abode upon him  
33	and i knew him not  but he that sent me to baptize with water  the same said unto me  upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending  and remaining on him  the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost  
34	and i saw  and bare record that this is the son of god  
35	again the next day after john stood  and two of his disciples  
36	and looking upon jesus as he walked  he saith  behold the lamb of god  
37 	and the two disciples heard him speak  and they followed jesus  
38	then jesus turned  and saw them following  and saith unto them  what seek ye  they said unto him  rabbi   which is to say  being interpreted  master   where dwellest thou  
39	he saith unto them  come and see  they came and saw where he dwelt  and abode with him that day  for it was about the tenth hour  
40	one of the two which heard john  speak   and followed him  was andrew  simon peter s brother  
41	he first findeth his own brother simon  and saith unto him  we have found the messias  which is  being interpreted  the christ  
42	and he brought him to jesus  and when jesus beheld him  he said  thou art simon the son of jona  thou shalt be called cephas  which is by interpretation  a stone  
43 	the day following jesus would go forth into galilee  and findeth philip  and saith unto him  follow me  
44	now philip was of bethsaida  the city of andrew and peter  
45	philip findeth nathanael  and saith unto him  we have found him  of whom moses in the law  and the prophets  did write  jesus of nazareth  the son of joseph  
46	and nathanael said unto him  can there any good thing come out of nazareth  philip saith unto him  come and see  
47	jesus saw nathanael coming to him  and saith of him  behold an israelite indeed  in whom is no guile  
48	nathanael saith unto him  whence knowest thou me  jesus answered and said unto him  before that philip called thee  when thou wast under the fig tree  i saw thee  
49	nathanael answered and saith unto him  rabbi  thou art the son of god  thou art the king of israel  
50	jesus answered and said unto him  because i said unto thee  i saw thee under the fig tree  believest thou  thou shalt see greater things than these  
51	and he saith unto him  verily  verily  i say unto you  hereafter ye shall see heaven open  and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man  
john 2
1 	and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee  and the mother of jesus was there  
2	and both jesus was called  and his disciples  to the marriage  
3	and when they wanted wine  the mother of jesus saith unto him  they have no wine  
4	jesus saith unto her  woman  what have i to do with thee  mine hour is not yet come  
5	his mother saith unto the servants  whatsoever he saith unto you  do  it   
6	and there were set there six waterpots of stone  after the manner of the purifying of the jews  containing two or three firkins apiece  
7	jesus saith unto them  fill the waterpots with water  and they filled them up to the brim  
8	and he saith unto them  draw out now  and bear unto the governor of the feast  and they bare  it   
9	when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine  and knew not whence it was   but the servants which drew the water knew   the governor of the feast called the bridegroom  
10	and saith unto him  every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine  and when men have well drunk  then that which is worse   but  thou hast kept the good wine until now  
11	this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee  and manifested forth his glory  and his disciples believed on him  
12 	after this he went down to capernaum  he  and his mother  and his brethren  and his disciples  and they continued there not many days  
13	and the jews  passover was at hand  and jesus went up to jerusalem  
14	and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves  and the changers of money sitting  
15	and when he had made a scourge of small cords  he drove them all out of the temple  and the sheep  and the oxen  and poured out the changers  money  and overthrew the tables  
16	and said unto them that sold doves  take these things hence  make not my father s house an house of merchandise  
17	and his disciples remembered that it was written  the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up  
18	then answered the jews and said unto him  what sign shewest thou unto us  seeing that thou doest these things  
19	jesus answered and said unto them  destroy this temple  and in three days i will raise it up  
20	then said the jews  forty and six years was this temple in building  and wilt thou rear it up in three days  
21	but he spake of the temple of his body  
22	when therefore he was risen from the dead  his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them  and they believed the scripture  and the word which jesus had said  
23 	now when he was in jerusalem at the passover  in the feast  day   many believed in his name  when they saw the miracles which he did  
24	but jesus did not commit himself unto them  because he knew all  men   
25	and needed not that any should testify of man  for he knew what was in man  
john 3
1 	there was a man of the pharisees  named nicodemus  a ruler of the jews  
2	the same came to jesus by night  and said unto him  rabbi  we know that thou art a teacher come from god  for no man can do these miracles that thou doest  except god be with him  
3	jesus answered and said unto him  verily  verily  i say unto thee  except a man be born again  he cannot see the kingdom of god  
4	nicodemus saith unto him  how can a man be born when he is old  can he enter the second time into his mother s womb  and be born  
5	jesus answered  verily  verily  i say unto thee  except a man be born of water and  of  the spirit  he cannot enter into the kingdom of god  
6	that which is born of the flesh is flesh  and that which is born of the spirit is spirit  
7	marvel not that i said unto thee  ye must be born again  
8	the wind bloweth where it listeth  and thou hearest the sound thereof  but canst not tell whence it cometh  and whither it goeth  so is every one that is born of the spirit  
9	nicodemus answered and said unto him  how can these things be  
10	jesus answered and said unto him  art thou a master of israel  and knowest not these things  
11	verily  verily  i say unto thee  we speak that we do know  and testify that we have seen  and ye receive not our witness  
12	if i have told you earthly things  and ye believe not  how shall ye believe  if i tell you  of  heavenly things  
13	and no man hath ascended up to heaven  but he that came down from heaven   even  the son of man which is in heaven  
14	and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness  even so must the son of man be lifted up  
15	that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have eternal life  
16	for god so loved the world  that he gave his only begotten son  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have everlasting life  
17	for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world  but that the world through him might be saved  
18	he that believeth on him is not condemned  but he that believeth not is condemned already  because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god  
19	and this is the condemnation  that light is come into the world  and men loved darkness rather than light  because their deeds were evil  
20	for every one that doeth evil hateth the light  neither cometh to the light  lest his deeds should be reproved  
21	but he that doeth truth cometh to the light  that his deeds may be made manifest  that they are wrought in god  
22 	after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea  and there he tarried with them  and baptized  
23	and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim  because there was much water there  and they came  and were baptized  
24	for john was not yet cast into prison  
25	then there arose a question between  some  of john s disciples and the jews about purifying  
26	and they came unto john  and said unto him  rabbi  he that was with thee beyond jordan  to whom thou barest witness  behold  the same baptizeth  and all  men  come to him  
27	john answered and said  a man can receive nothing  except it be given him from heaven  
28	ye yourselves bear me witness  that i said  i am not the christ  but that i am sent before him  
29	he that hath the bride is the bridegroom  but the friend of the bridegroom  which standeth and heareth him  rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom s voice  this my joy therefore is fulfilled  
30	he must increase  but i  must  decrease  
31	he that cometh from above is above all  he that is of the earth is earthly  and speaketh of the earth  he that cometh from heaven is above all  
32	and what he hath seen and heard  that he testifieth  and no man receiveth his testimony  
33	he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true  
34	for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god  for god giveth not the spirit by measure  unto him   
35	the father loveth the son  and hath given all things into his hand  
36	he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life  and he that believeth not the son shall not see life  but the wrath of god abideth on him  
john 4
1 	when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john  
2	 though jesus himself baptized not  but his disciples   
3	he left judaea  and departed again into galilee  
4 	and he must needs go through samaria  
5	then cometh he to a city of samaria  which is called sychar  near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph  
6	now jacob s well was there  jesus therefore  being wearied with  his  journey  sat thus on the well   and  it was about the sixth hour  
7	there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water  jesus saith unto her  give me to drink  
8	 for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat   
9	then saith the woman of samaria unto him  how is it that thou  being a jew  askest drink of me  which am a woman of samaria  for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans  
10	jesus answered and said unto her  if thou knewest the gift of god  and who it is that saith to thee  give me to drink  thou wouldest have asked of him  and he would have given thee living water  
11	the woman saith unto him  sir  thou hast nothing to draw with  and the well is deep  from whence then hast thou that living water  
12	art thou greater than our father jacob  which gave us the well  and drank thereof himself  and his children  and his cattle  
13	jesus answered and said unto her  whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again  
14	but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst  but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life  
15	the woman saith unto him  sir  give me this water  that i thirst not  neither come hither to draw  
16	jesus saith unto her  go  call thy husband  and come hither  
17	the woman answered and said  i have no husband  jesus said unto her  thou hast well said  i have no husband  
18	for thou hast had five husbands  and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband  in that saidst thou truly  
19	the woman saith unto him  sir  i perceive that thou art a prophet  
20	our fathers worshipped in this mountain  and ye say  that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship  
21	jesus saith unto her  woman  believe me  the hour cometh  when ye shall neither in this mountain  nor yet at jerusalem  worship the father  
22	ye worship ye know not what  we know what we worship  for salvation is of the jews  
23	but the hour cometh  and now is  when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth  for the father seeketh such to worship him  
24	god  is  a spirit  and they that worship him must worship  him  in spirit and in truth  
25	the woman saith unto him  i know that messias cometh  which is called christ  when he is come  he will tell us all things  
26	jesus saith unto her  i that speak unto thee am  he   
27 	and upon this came his disciples  and marvelled that he talked with the woman  yet no man said  what seekest thou  or  why talkest thou with her  
28	the woman then left her waterpot  and went her way into the city  and saith to the men  
29	come  see a man  which told me all things that ever i did  is not this the christ  
30	then they went out of the city  and came unto him  
31	in the mean while his disciples prayed him  saying  master  eat  
32	but he said unto them  i have meat to eat that ye know not of  
33	therefore said the disciples one to another  hath any man brought him  ought  to eat  
34	jesus saith unto them  my meat is to do the will of him that sent me  and to finish his work  
35	say not ye  there are yet four months  and  then  cometh harvest  behold  i say unto you  lift up your eyes  and look on the fields  for they are white already to harvest  
36	and he that reapeth receiveth wages  and gathereth fruit unto life eternal  that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together  
37	and herein is that saying true  one soweth  and another reapeth  
38	i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour  other men laboured  and ye are entered into their labours  
39	and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman  which testified  he told me all that ever i did  
40	so when the samaritans were come unto him  they besought him that he would tarry with them  and he abode there two days  
41	and many more believed because of his own word  
42	and said unto the woman  now we believe  not because of thy saying  for we have heard  him  ourselves  and know that this is indeed the christ  the saviour of the world  
43 	now after two days he departed thence  and went into galilee  
44	for jesus himself testified  that a prophet hath no honour in his own country  
45	then when he was come into galilee  the galilaeans received him  having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast  for they also went unto the feast  
46	so jesus came again into cana of galilee  where he made the water wine  and there was a certain nobleman  whose son was sick at capernaum  
47	when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee  he went unto him  and besought him that he would come down  and heal his son  for he was at the point of death  
48	then said jesus unto him  except ye see signs and wonders  ye will not believe  
49	the nobleman saith unto him  sir  come down ere my child die  
50	jesus saith unto him  go thy way  thy son liveth  and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him  and he went his way  
51	and as he was now going down  his servants met him  and told  him   saying  thy son liveth  
52	then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend  and they said unto him  yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him  
53	so the father knew that  it was  at the same hour  in the which jesus said unto him  thy son liveth  and himself believed  and his whole house  
54	this  is  again the second miracle  that  jesus did  when he was come out of judaea into galilee  
john 5
1 	after this there was a feast of the jews  and jesus went up to jerusalem  
2	now there is at jerusalem by the sheep  market  a pool  which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda  having five porches  
3	in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk  of blind  halt  withered  waiting for the moving of the water  
4	for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool  and troubled the water  whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had  
5	and a certain man was there  which had an infirmity thirty and eight years  
6	when jesus saw him lie  and knew that he had been now a long time  in that case   he saith unto him  wilt thou be made whole  
7	the impotent man answered him  sir  i have no man  when the water is troubled  to put me into the pool  but while i am coming  another steppeth down before me  
8	jesus saith unto him  rise  take up thy bed  and walk  
9	and immediately the man was made whole  and took up his bed  and walked  and on the same day was the sabbath  
10	the jews therefore said unto him that was cured  it is the sabbath day  it is not lawful for thee to carry  thy  bed  
11	he answered them  he that made me whole  the same said unto me  take up thy bed  and walk  
12	then asked they him  what man is that which said unto thee  take up thy bed  and walk  
13	and he that was healed wist not who it was  for jesus had conveyed himself away  a multitude being in  that  place  
14	afterward jesus findeth him in the temple  and said unto him  behold  thou art made whole  sin no more  lest a worse thing come unto thee  
15	the man departed  and told the jews that it was jesus  which had made him whole  
16	and therefore did the jews persecute jesus  and sought to slay him  because he had done these things on the sabbath day  
17 	but jesus answered them  my father worketh hitherto  and i work  
18	therefore the jews sought the more to kill him  because he not only had broken the sabbath  but said also that god was his father  making himself equal with god  
19	then answered jesus and said unto them  verily  verily  i say unto you  the son can do nothing of himself  but what he seeth the father do  for what things soever he doeth  these also doeth the son likewise  
20	for the father loveth the son  and sheweth him all things that himself doeth  and he will shew him greater works than these  that ye may marvel  
21	for as the father raiseth up the dead  and quickeneth  them   even so the son quickeneth whom he will  
22	for the father judgeth no man  but hath committed all judgment unto the son  
23	that all  men  should honour the son  even as they honour the father  he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him  
24	verily  verily  i say unto you  he that heareth my word  and believeth on him that sent me  hath everlasting life  and shall not come into condemnation  but is passed from death unto life  
25	verily  verily  i say unto you  the hour is coming  and now is  when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god  and they that hear shall live  
26	for as the father hath life in himself  so hath he given to the son to have life in himself  
27	and hath given him authority to execute judgment also  because he is the son of man  
28	marvel not at this  for the hour is coming  in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice  
29	and shall come forth  they that have done good  unto the resurrection of life  and they that have done evil  unto the resurrection of damnation  
30	i can of mine own self do nothing  as i hear  i judge  and my judgment is just  because i seek not mine own will  but the will of the father which hath sent me  
31 	if i bear witness of myself  my witness is not true  
32	there is another that beareth witness of me  and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true  
33	ye sent unto john  and he bare witness unto the truth  
34	but i receive not testimony from man  but these things i say  that ye might be saved  
35	he was a burning and a shining light  and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light  
36	but i have greater witness than  that  of john  for the works which the father hath given me to finish  the same works that i do  bear witness of me  that the father hath sent me  
37	and the father himself  which hath sent me  hath borne witness of me  ye have neither heard his voice at any time  nor seen his shape  
38	and ye have not his word abiding in you  for whom he hath sent  him ye believe not  
39	search the scriptures  for in them ye think ye have eternal life  and they are they which testify of me  
40	and ye will not come to me  that ye might have life  
41	i receive not honour from men  
42	but i know you  that ye have not the love of god in you  
43	i am come in my father s name  and ye receive me not  if another shall come in his own name  him ye will receive  
44	how can ye believe  which receive honour one of another  and seek not the honour that  cometh  from god only  
45	do not think that i will accuse you to the father  there is  one  that accuseth you   even  moses  in whom ye trust  
46	for had ye believed moses  ye would have believed me  for he wrote of me  
47	but if ye believe not his writings  how shall ye believe my words

1 	after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee  which is  the sea  of tiberias  
2	and a great multitude followed him  because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased  
3	and jesus went up into a mountain  and there he sat with his disciples  
4	and the passover  a feast of the jews  was nigh  
5	when jesus then lifted up  his  eyes  and saw a great company come unto him  he saith unto philip  whence shall we buy bread  that these may eat  
6	and this he said to prove him  for he himself knew what he would do  
7	philip answered him  two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them  that every one of them may take a little  
8	one of his disciples  andrew  simon peter s brother  saith unto him  
9	there is a lad here  which hath five barley loaves  and two small fishes  but what are they among so many  
10	and jesus said  make the men sit down  now there was much grass in the place  so the men sat down  in number about five thousand  
11	and jesus took the loaves  and when he had given thanks  he distributed to the disciples  and the disciples to them that were set down  and likewise of the fishes as much as they would  
12	when they were filled  he said unto his disciples  gather up the fragments that remain  that nothing be lost  
13	therefore they gathered  them  together  and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves  which remained over and above unto them that had eaten  
14	then those men  when they had seen the miracle that jesus did  said  this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world  
15 	when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force  to make him a king  he departed again into a mountain himself alone  
16	and when even was  now  come  his disciples went down unto the sea  
17	and entered into a ship  and went over the sea toward capernaum  and it was now dark  and jesus was not come to them  
18	and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew  
19	so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs  they see jesus walking on the sea  and drawing nigh unto the ship  and they were afraid  
20	but he saith unto them  it is i  be not afraid  
21	then they willingly received him into the ship  and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went  
22 	the day following  when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there  save that one whereinto his disciples were entered  and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat  but  that  his disciples were gone away alone  
23	 howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread  after that the lord had given thanks   
24	when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there  neither his disciples  they also took shipping  and came to capernaum  seeking for jesus  
25	and when they had found him on the other side of the sea  they said unto him  rabbi  when camest thou hither  
26	jesus answered them and said  verily  verily  i say unto you  ye seek me  not because ye saw the miracles  but because ye did eat of the loaves  and were filled  
27	labour not for the meat which perisheth  but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life  which the son of man shall give unto you  for him hath god the father sealed  
28 	then said they unto him  what shall we do  that we might work the works of god  
29	jesus answered and said unto them  this is the work of god  that ye believe on him whom he hath sent  
30	they said therefore unto him  what sign shewest thou then  that we may see  and believe thee  what dost thou work  
31	our fathers did eat manna in the desert  as it is written  he gave them bread from heaven to eat  
32	then jesus said unto them  verily  verily  i say unto you  moses gave you not that bread from heaven  but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven  
33	for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven  and giveth life unto the world  
34	then said they unto him  lord  evermore give us this bread  
35	and jesus said unto them  i am the bread of life  he that cometh to me shall never hunger  and he that believeth on me shall never thirst  
36	but i said unto you  that ye also have seen me  and believe not  
37	all that the father giveth me shall come to me  and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  
38	for i came down from heaven  not to do mine own will  but the will of him that sent me  
39	and this is the father s will which hath sent me  that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing  but should raise it up again at the last day  
40	and this is the will of him that sent me  that every one which seeth the son  and believeth on him  may have everlasting life  and i will raise him up at the last day  
41	the jews then murmured at him  because he said  i am the bread which came down from heaven  
42	and they said  is not this jesus  the son of joseph  whose father and mother we know  how is it then that he saith  i came down from heaven  
43	jesus therefore answered and said unto them  murmur not among yourselves  
44	no man can come to me  except the father which hath sent me draw him  and i will raise him up at the last day  
45	it is written in the prophets  and they shall be all taught of god  every man therefore that hath heard  and hath learned of the father  cometh unto me  
46	not that any man hath seen the father  save he which is of god  he hath seen the father  
47	verily  verily  i say unto you  he that believeth on me hath everlasting life  
48	i am that bread of life  
49	your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness  and are dead  
50	this is the bread which cometh down from heaven  that a man may eat thereof  and not die  
51	i am the living bread which came down from heaven  if any man eat of this bread  he shall live for ever  and the bread that i will give is my flesh  which i will give for the life of the world  
52	the jews therefore strove among themselves  saying  how can this man give us  his  flesh to eat  
53	then jesus said unto them  verily  verily  i say unto you  except ye eat the flesh of the son of man  and drink his blood  ye have no life in you  
54	whoso eateth my flesh  and drinketh my blood  hath eternal life  and i will raise him up at the last day  
55	for my flesh is meat indeed  and my blood is drink indeed  
56	he that eateth my flesh  and drinketh my blood  dwelleth in me  and i in him  
57	as the living father hath sent me  and i live by the father  so he that eateth me  even he shall live by me  
58	this is that bread which came down from heaven  not as your fathers did eat manna  and are dead  he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever  
59	these things said he in the synagogue  as he taught in capernaum  
60 	many therefore of his disciples  when they had heard  this   said  this is an hard saying  who can hear it  
61	when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it  he said unto them  doth this offend you  
62	 what  and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before  
63	it is the spirit that quickeneth  the flesh profiteth nothing  the words that i speak unto you   they  are spirit  and  they  are life  
64	but there are some of you that believe not  for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not  and who should betray him  
65	and he said  therefore said i unto you  that no man can come unto me  except it were given unto him of my father  
66	from that  time  many of his disciples went back  and walked no more with him  
67	then said jesus unto the twelve  will ye also go away  
68	then simon peter answered him  lord  to whom shall we go  thou hast the words of eternal life  
69	and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ  the son of the living god  
70	jesus answered them  have not i chosen you twelve  and one of you is a devil  
71	he spake of judas iscariot  the son  of simon  for he it was that should betray him  being one of the twelve  
john 7
1 	after these things jesus walked in galilee  for he would not walk in jewry  because the jews sought to kill him  
2	now the jews  feast of tabernacles was at hand  
3	his brethren therefore said unto him  depart hence  and go into judaea  that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest  
4	for  there is  no man  that  doeth any thing in secret  and he himself seeketh to be known openly  if thou do these things  shew thyself to the world  
5	for neither did his brethren believe in him  
6	then jesus said unto them  my time is not yet come  but your time is alway ready  
7	the world cannot hate you  but me it hateth  because i testify of it  that the works thereof are evil  
8	go ye up unto this feast  i go not up yet unto this feast  for my time is not yet full come  
9	when he had said these words unto them  he abode  still  in galilee  
10	but when his brethren were gone up  then went he also up unto the feast  not openly  but as it were in secret  
11	then the jews sought him at the feast  and said  where is he  
12	and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him  for some said  he is a good man  others said  nay  but he deceiveth the people  
13	howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews  
14 	now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple  and taught  
15	and the jews marvelled  saying  how knoweth this man letters  having never learned  
16	jesus answered them  and said  my doctrine is not mine  but his that sent me  
17	if any man will do his will  he shall know of the doctrine  whether it be of god  or  whether  i speak of myself  
18	he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory  but he that seeketh his glory that sent him  the same is true  and no unrighteousness is in him  
19	did not moses give you the law  and  yet  none of you keepeth the law  why go ye about to kill me  
20	the people answered and said  thou hast a devil  who goeth about to kill thee  
21	jesus answered and said unto them  i have done one work  and ye all marvel  
22	moses therefore gave unto you circumcision   not because it is of moses  but of the fathers   and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man  
23	if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision  that the law of moses should not be broken  are ye angry at me  because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day  
24	judge not according to the appearance  but judge righteous judgment  
25	then said some of them of jerusalem  is not this he  whom they seek to kill  
26	but  lo  he speaketh boldly  and they say nothing unto him  do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ  
27	howbeit we know this man whence he is  but when christ cometh  no man knoweth whence he is  
28	then cried jesus in the temple as he taught  saying  ye both know me  and ye know whence i am  and i am not come of myself  but he that sent me is true  whom ye know not  
29	but i know him  for i am from him  and he hath sent me  
30	then they sought to take him  but no man laid hands on him  because his hour was not yet come  
31	and many of the people believed on him  and said  when christ cometh  will he do more miracles than these which this  man  hath done  
32	the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him  and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him  
33	then said jesus unto them  yet a little while am i with you  and  then  i go unto him that sent me  
34	ye shall seek me  and shall not find  me   and where i am   thither  ye cannot come  
35	then said the jews among themselves  whither will he go  that we shall not find him  will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles  and teach the gentiles  
36	what  manner of  saying is this that he said  ye shall seek me  and shall not find  me   and where i am   thither  ye cannot come  
37 	in the last day  that great  day  of the feast  jesus stood and cried  saying  if any man thirst  let him come unto me  and drink  
38	he that believeth on me  as the scripture hath said  out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water  
39	 but this spake he of the spirit  which they that believe on him should receive  for the holy ghost was not yet  given   because that jesus was not yet glorified   
40	many of the people therefore  when they heard this saying  said  of a truth this is the prophet  
41	others said  this is the christ  but some said  shall christ come out of galilee  
42	hath not the scripture said  that christ cometh of the seed of david  and out of the town of bethlehem  where david was  
43	so there was a division among the people because of him  
44	and some of them would have taken him  but no man laid hands on him  
45 	then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees  and they said unto them  why have ye not brought him  
46	the officers answered  never man spake like this man  
47	then answered them the pharisees  are ye also deceived  
48	have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him  
49	but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed  
50	nicodemus saith unto them   he that came to jesus by night  being one of them   
51	doth our law judge  any  man  before it hear him  and know what he doeth  
52	they answered and said unto him  art thou also of galilee  search  and look  for out of galilee ariseth no prophet  
53	and every man went unto his own house  
john 8
1 	jesus went unto the mount of olives  
2	and early in the morning he came again into the temple  and all the people came unto him  and he sat down  and taught them  
3	and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery  and when they had set her in the midst  
4	they say unto him  master  this woman was taken in adultery  in the very act  
5	now moses in the law commanded us  that such should be stoned  but what sayest thou  
6	this they said  tempting him  that they might have to accuse him  but jesus stooped down  and with  his  finger wrote on the ground   as though he heard them not   
7	so when they continued asking him  he lifted up himself  and said unto them  he that is without sin among you  let him first cast a stone at her  
8	and again he stooped down  and wrote on the ground  
9	and they which heard  it   being convicted by  their own  conscience  went out one by one  beginning at the eldest   even  unto the last  and jesus was left alone  and the woman standing in the midst  
10	when jesus had lifted up himself  and saw none but the woman  he said unto her  woman  where are those thine accusers  hath no man condemned thee  
11	she said  no man  lord  and jesus said unto her  neither do i condemn thee  go  and sin no more  
12 	then spake jesus again unto them  saying  i am the light of the world  he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness  but shall have the light of life  
13	the pharisees therefore said unto him  thou bearest record of thyself  thy record is not true  
14	jesus answered and said unto them  though i bear record of myself   yet  my record is true  for i know whence i came  and whither i go  but ye cannot tell whence i come  and whither i go  
15	ye judge after the flesh  i judge no man  
16	and yet if i judge  my judgment is true  for i am not alone  but i and the father that sent me  
17	it is also written in your law  that the testimony of two men is true  
18	i am one that bear witness of myself  and the father that sent me beareth witness of me  
19	then said they unto him  where is thy father  jesus answered  ye neither know me  nor my father  if ye had known me  ye should have known my father also  
20	these words spake jesus in the treasury  as he taught in the temple  and no man laid hands on him  for his hour was not yet come  
21 	then said jesus again unto them  i go my way  and ye shall seek me  and shall die in your sins  whither i go  ye cannot come  
22	then said the jews  will he kill himself  because he saith  whither i go  ye cannot come  
23	and he said unto them  ye are from beneath  i am from above  ye are of this world  i am not of this world  
24	i said therefore unto you  that ye shall die in your sins  for if ye believe not that i am  he   ye shall die in your sins  
25	then said they unto him  who art thou  and jesus saith unto them  even  the same  that i said unto you from the beginning  
26	i have many things to say and to judge of you  but he that sent me is true  and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him  
27	they understood not that he spake to them of the father  
28	then said jesus unto them  when ye have lifted up the son of man  then shall ye know that i am  he   and  that  i do nothing of myself  but as my father hath taught me  i speak these things  
29	and he that sent me is with me  the father hath not left me alone  for i do always those things that please him  
30	as he spake these words  many believed on him  
31 	then said jesus to those jews which believed on him  if ye continue in my word   then  are ye my disciples indeed  
32	and ye shall know the truth  and the truth shall make you free  
33	they answered him  we be abraham s seed  and were never in bondage to any man  how sayest thou  ye shall be made free  
34	jesus answered them  verily  verily  i say unto you  whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin  
35	and the servant abideth not in the house for ever   but  the son abideth ever  
36	if the son therefore shall make you free  ye shall be free indeed  
37	i know that ye are abraham s seed  but ye seek to kill me  because my word hath no place in you  
38 	i speak that which i have seen with my father  and ye do that which ye have seen with your father  
39	they answered and said unto him  abraham is our father  jesus saith unto them  if ye were abraham s children  ye would do the works of abraham  
40	but now ye seek to kill me  a man that hath told you the truth  which i have heard of god  this did not abraham  
41	ye do the deeds of your father  then said they to him  we be not born of fornication  we have one father   even  god  
42	jesus said unto them  if god were your father  ye would love me  for i proceeded forth and came from god  neither came i of myself  but he sent me  
43	why do ye not understand my speech   even  because ye cannot hear my word  
44	ye are of  your  father the devil  and the lusts of your father ye will do  he was a murderer from the beginning  and abode not in the truth  because there is no truth in him  when he speaketh a lie  he speaketh of his own  for he is a liar  and the father of it  
45	and because i tell  you  the truth  ye believe me not  
46 	which of you convinceth me of sin  and if i say the truth  why do ye not believe me  
47	he that is of god heareth god s words  ye therefore hear  them  not  because ye are not of god  
48	then answered the jews  and said unto him  say we not well that thou art a samaritan  and hast a devil  
49	jesus answered  i have not a devil  but i honour my father  and ye do dishonour me  
50	and i seek not mine own glory  there is one that seeketh and judgeth  
51 	verily  verily  i say unto you  if a man keep my saying  he shall never see death  
52	then said the jews unto him  now we know that thou hast a devil  abraham is dead  and the prophets  and thou sayest  if a man keep my saying  he shall never taste of death  
53	art thou greater than our father abraham  which is dead  and the prophets are dead  whom makest thou thyself  
54	jesus answered  if i honour myself  my honour is nothing  it is my father that honoureth me  of whom ye say  that he is your god  
55	yet ye have not known him  but i know him  and if i should say  i know him not  i shall be a liar like unto you  but i know him  and keep his saying  
56	your father abraham rejoiced to see my day  and he saw  it   and was glad  
57	then said the jews unto him  thou art not yet fifty years old  and hast thou seen abraham  
58	jesus said unto them  verily  verily  i say unto you  before abraham was  i am  
59	then took they up stones to cast at him  but jesus hid himself  and went out of the temple  going through the midst of them  and so passed by  
john 9
1 	and as  jesus  passed by  he saw a man which was blind from  his  birth  
2	and his disciples asked him  saying  master  who did sin  this man  or his parents  that he was born blind  
3	jesus answered  neither hath this man sinned  nor his parents  but that the works of god should be made manifest in him  
4	i must work the works of him that sent me  while it is day  the night cometh  when no man can work  
5	as long as i am in the world  i am the light of the world  
6	when he had thus spoken  he spat on the ground  and made clay of the spittle  and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay  
7	and said unto him  go  wash in the pool of siloam   which is by interpretation  sent   he went his way therefore  and washed  and came seeing  
8 	the neighbours therefore  and they which before had seen him that he was blind  said  is not this he that sat and begged  
9	some said  this is he  others  said   he is like him   but  he said  i am  he   
10	therefore said they unto him  how were thine eyes opened  
11	he answered and said  a man that is called jesus made clay  and anointed mine eyes  and said unto me  go to the pool of siloam  and wash  and i went and washed  and i received sight  
12	then said they unto him  where is he  he said  i know not  
13 	they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind  
14	and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay  and opened his eyes  
15	then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight  he said unto them  he put clay upon mine eyes  and i washed  and do see  
16	therefore said some of the pharisees  this man is not of god  because he keepeth not the sabbath day  others said  how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles  and there was a division among them  
17	they say unto the blind man again  what sayest thou of him  that he hath opened thine eyes  he said  he is a prophet  
18	but the jews did not believe concerning him  that he had been blind  and received his sight  until they called the parents of him that had received his sight  
19	and they asked them  saying  is this your son  who ye say was born blind  how then doth he now see  
20	his parents answered them and said  we know that this is our son  and that he was born blind  
21	but by what means he now seeth  we know not  or who hath opened his eyes  we know not  he is of age  ask him  he shall speak for himself  
22	these  words  spake his parents  because they feared the jews  for the jews had agreed already  that if any man did confess that he was christ  he should be put out of the synagogue  
23	therefore said his parents  he is of age  ask him  
24	then again called they the man that was blind  and said unto him  give god the praise  we know that this man is a sinner  
25	he answered and said  whether he be a sinner  or no   i know not  one thing i know  that  whereas i was blind  now i see  
26	then said they to him again  what did he to thee  how opened he thine eyes  
27	he answered them  i have told you already  and ye did not hear  wherefore would ye hear  it  again  will ye also be his disciples  
28	then they reviled him  and said  thou art his disciple  but we are moses  disciples  
29	we know that god spake unto moses   as for  this  fellow   we know not from whence he is  
30	the man answered and said unto them  why herein is a marvellous thing  that ye know not from whence he is  and  yet  he hath opened mine eyes  
31	now we know that god heareth not sinners  but if any man be a worshipper of god  and doeth his will  him he heareth  
32	since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind  
33	if this man were not of god  he could do nothing  
34	they answered and said unto him  thou wast altogether born in sins  and dost thou teach us  and they cast him out  
35 	jesus heard that they had cast him out  and when he had found him  he said unto him  dost thou believe on the son of god  
36	he answered and said  who is he  lord  that i might believe on him  
37	and jesus said unto him  thou hast both seen him  and it is he that talketh with thee  
38	and he said  lord  i believe  and he worshipped him  
39 	and jesus said  for judgment i am come into this world  that they which see not might see  and that they which see might be made blind  
40	and  some  of the pharisees which were with him heard these words  and said unto him  are we blind also  
41	jesus said unto them  if ye were blind  ye should have no sin  but now ye say  we see  therefore your sin remaineth  
john 10
1 	verily  verily  i say unto you  he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold  but climbeth up some other way  the same is a thief and a robber  
2	but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep  
3	to him the porter openeth  and the sheep hear his voice  and he calleth his own sheep by name  and leadeth them out  
4	and when he putteth forth his own sheep  he goeth before them  and the sheep follow him  for they know his voice  
5	and a stranger will they not follow  but will flee from him  for they know not the voice of strangers  
6	this parable spake jesus unto them  but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them  
7	then said jesus unto them again  verily  verily  i say unto you  i am the door of the sheep  
8	all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers  but the sheep did not hear them  
9	i am the door  by me if any man enter in  he shall be saved  and shall go in and out  and find pasture  
10	the thief cometh not  but for to steal  and to kill  and to destroy  i am come that they might have life  and that they might have  it  more abundantly  
11	i am the good shepherd  the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep  
12	but he that is an hireling  and not the shepherd  whose own the sheep are not  seeth the wolf coming  and leaveth the sheep  and fleeth  and the wolf catcheth them  and scattereth the sheep  
13	the hireling fleeth  because he is an hireling  and careth not for the sheep  
14	i am the good shepherd  and know my  sheep   and am known of mine  
15	as the father knoweth me  even so know i the father  and i lay down my life for the sheep  
16	and other sheep i have  which are not of this fold  them also i must bring  and they shall hear my voice  and there shall be one fold   and  one shepherd  
17	therefore doth my father love me  because i lay down my life  that i might take it again  
18	no man taketh it from me  but i lay it down of myself  i have power to lay it down  and i have power to take it again  this commandment have i received of my father  
19 	there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings  
20	and many of them said  he hath a devil  and is mad  why hear ye him  
21	others said  these are not the words of him that hath a devil  can a devil open the eyes of the blind  
22 	and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication  and it was winter  
23	and jesus walked in the temple in solomon s porch  
24	then came the jews round about him  and said unto him  how long dost thou make us to doubt  if thou be the christ  tell us plainly  
25	jesus answered them  i told you  and ye believed not  the works that i do in my father s name  they bear witness of me  
26	but ye believe not  because ye are not of my sheep  as i said unto you  
27	my sheep hear my voice  and i know them  and they follow me  
28	and i give unto them eternal life  and they shall never perish  neither shall any  man  pluck them out of my hand  
29	my father  which gave  them  me  is greater than all  and no  man  is able to pluck  them  out of my father s hand  
30	i and  my  father are one  
31	then the jews took up stones again to stone him  
32	jesus answered them  many good works have i shewed you from my father  for which of those works do ye stone me  
33	the jews answered him  saying  for a good work we stone thee not  but for blasphemy  and because that thou  being a man  makest thyself god  
34	jesus answered them  is it not written in your law  i said  ye are gods  
35	if he called them gods  unto whom the word of god came  and the scripture cannot be broken  
36	say ye of him  whom the father hath sanctified  and sent into the world  thou blasphemest  because i said  i am the son of god  
37	if i do not the works of my father  believe me not  
38	but if i do  though ye believe not me  believe the works  that ye may know  and believe  that the father  is  in me  and i in him  
39 	therefore they sought again to take him  but he escaped out of their hand  
40	and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized  and there he abode  
41	and many resorted unto him  and said  john did no miracle  but all things that john spake of this man were true  
42	and many believed on him there  
john 11
1 	now a certain  man  was sick   named  lazarus  of bethany  the town of mary and her sister martha  
2	 it was  that  mary which anointed the lord with ointment  and wiped his feet with her hair  whose brother lazarus was sick   
3	therefore his sisters sent unto him  saying  lord  behold  he whom thou lovest is sick  
4	when jesus heard  that   he said  this sickness is not unto death  but for the glory of god  that the son of god might be glorified thereby  
5	now jesus loved martha  and her sister  and lazarus  
6	when he had heard therefore that he was sick  he abode two days still in the same place where he was  
7	then after that saith he to  his  disciples  let us go into judaea again  
8	 his  disciples say unto him  master  the jews of late sought to stone thee  and goest thou thither again  
9	jesus answered  are there not twelve hours in the day  if any man walk in the day  he stumbleth not  because he seeth the light of this world  
10	but if a man walk in the night  he stumbleth  because there is no light in him  
11	these things said he  and after that he saith unto them  our friend lazarus sleepeth  but i go  that i may awake him out of sleep  
12	then said his disciples  lord  if he sleep  he shall do well  
13	howbeit jesus spake of his death  but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep  
14	then said jesus unto them plainly  lazarus is dead  
15	and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there  to the intent ye may believe  nevertheless let us go unto him  
16	then said thomas  which is called didymus  unto his fellowdisciples  let us also go  that we may die with him  
17 	then when jesus came  he found that he had  lain  in the grave four days already  
18	now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem  about fifteen furlongs off  
19	and many of the jews came to martha and mary  to comfort them concerning their brother  
20	then martha  as soon as she heard that jesus was coming  went and met him  but mary sat  still  in the house  
21	then said martha unto jesus  lord  if thou hadst been here  my brother had not died  
22	but i know  that even now  whatsoever thou wilt ask of god  god will give  it  thee  
23	jesus saith unto her  thy brother shall rise again  
24	martha saith unto him  i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day  
25	jesus said unto her  i am the resurrection  and the life  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  
26	and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die  believest thou this  
27	she saith unto him  yea  lord  i believe that thou art the christ  the son of god  which should come into the world  
28	and when she had so said  she went her way  and called mary her sister secretly  saying  the master is come  and calleth for thee  
29	as soon as she heard  that   she arose quickly  and came unto him  
30	now jesus was not yet come into the town  but was in that place where martha met him  
31	the jews then which were with her in the house  and comforted her  when they saw mary  that she rose up hastily and went out  followed her  saying  she goeth unto the grave to weep there  
32	then when mary was come where jesus was  and saw him  she fell down at his feet  saying unto him  lord  if thou hadst been here  my brother had not died  
33 	when jesus therefore saw her weeping  and the jews also weeping which came with her  he groaned in the spirit  and was troubled  
34	and said  where have ye laid him  they said unto him  lord  come and see  
35	jesus wept  
36	then said the jews  behold how he loved him  
37	and some of them said  could not this man  which opened the eyes of the blind  have caused that even this man should not have died  
38	jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave  it was a cave  and a stone lay upon it  
39	jesus said  take ye away the stone  martha  the sister of him that was dead  saith unto him  lord  by this time he stinketh  for he hath been  dead  four days  
40	jesus saith unto her  said i not unto thee  that  if thou wouldest believe  thou shouldest see the glory of god  
41	then they took away the stone  from the place  where the dead was laid  and jesus lifted up  his  eyes  and said  father  i thank thee that thou hast heard me  
42	and i knew that thou hearest me always  but because of the people which stand by i said  it   that they may believe that thou hast sent me  
43	and when he thus had spoken  he cried with a loud voice  lazarus  come forth  
44	and he that was dead came forth  bound hand and foot with graveclothes  and his face was bound about with a napkin  jesus saith unto them  loose him  and let him go  
45 	then many of the jews which came to mary  and had seen the things which jesus did  believed on him  
46	but some of them went their ways to the pharisees  and told them what things jesus had done  
47	then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council  and said  what do we  for this man doeth many miracles  
48	if we let him thus alone  all  men  will believe on him  and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation  
49	and one of them   named  caiaphas  being the high priest that same year  said unto them  ye know nothing at all  
50	nor consider that it is expedient for us  that one man should die for the people  and that the whole nation perish not  
51	and this spake he not of himself  but being high priest that year  he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation  
52	and not for that nation only  but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad  
53	then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death  
54	jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews  but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness  into a city called ephraim  and there continued with his disciples  
55	and the jews  passover was nigh at hand  and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover  to purify themselves  
56	then sought they for jesus  and spake among themselves  as they stood in the temple  what think ye  that he will not come to the feast  
57	now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment  that  if any man knew where he were  he should shew  it   that they might take him  
john 12
1 	then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany  where lazarus was which had been dead  whom he raised from the dead  
2	there they made him a supper  and martha served  but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him  
3	then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard  very costly  and anointed the feet of jesus  and wiped his feet with her hair  and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment  
4	then saith one of his disciples  judas iscariot  simon s  son   which should betray him  
5	why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence  and given to the poor  
6	this he said  not that he cared for the poor  but because he was a thief  and had the bag  and bare what was put therein  
7	then said jesus  let her alone  against the day of my burying hath she kept this  
8	for the poor always ye have with you  but me ye have not always  
9	much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there  and they came not for jesus  sake only  but that they might see lazarus also  whom he had raised from the dead  
10	but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death  
11	because that by reason of him many of the jews went away  and believed on jesus  
12 	on the next day much people that were come to the feast  when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem  
13	took branches of palm trees  and went forth to meet him  and cried  hosanna  blessed  is  the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord  
14	and jesus  when he had found a young ass  sat thereon  as it is written  
15	fear not  daughter of sion  behold  thy king cometh  sitting on an ass s colt  
16	these things understood not his disciples at the first  but when jesus was glorified  then remembered they that these things were written of him  and  that  they had done these things unto him  
17	the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave  and raised him from the dead  bare record  
18	for this cause the people also met him  for that they heard that he had done this miracle  
19	the pharisees therefore said among themselves  perceive ye how ye prevail nothing  behold  the world is gone after him  
20 	and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast  
21	the same came therefore to philip  which was of bethsaida of galilee  and desired him  saying  sir  we would see jesus  
22	philip cometh and telleth andrew  and again andrew and philip tell jesus  
23	and jesus answered them  saying  the hour is come  that the son of man should be glorified  
24	verily  verily  i say unto you  except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die  it abideth alone  but if it die  it bringeth forth much fruit  
25	he that loveth his life shall lose it  and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal  
26	if any man serve me  let him follow me  and where i am  there shall also my servant be  if any man serve me  him will  my  father honour  
27 	now is my soul troubled  and what shall i say  father  save me from this hour  but for this cause came i unto this hour  
28	father  glorify thy name  then came there a voice from heaven   saying   i have both glorified  it   and will glorify  it  again  
29	the people therefore  that stood by  and heard  it   said that it thundered  others said  an angel spake to him  
30	jesus answered and said  this voice came not because of me  but for your sakes  
31	now is the judgment of this world  now shall the prince of this world be cast out  
32	and i  if i be lifted up from the earth  will draw all  men  unto me  
33	this he said  signifying what death he should die  
34	the people answered him  we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever  and how sayest thou  the son of man must be lifted up  who is this son of man  
35	then jesus said unto them  yet a little while is the light with you  walk while ye have the light  lest darkness come upon you  for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth  
36	while ye have light  believe in the light  that ye may be the children of light  these things spake jesus  and departed  and did hide himself from them  
37 	but though he had done so many miracles before them  yet they believed not on him  
38	that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled  which he spake  lord  who hath believed our report  and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed  
39	therefore they could not believe  because that esaias said again  
40	he hath blinded their eyes  and hardened their heart  that they should not see with  their  eyes  nor understand with  their  heart  and be converted  and i should heal them  
41	these things said esaias  when he saw his glory  and spake of him  
42 	nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him  but because of the pharisees they did not confess  him   lest they should be put out of the synagogue  
43	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god  
44 	jesus cried and said  he that believeth on me  believeth not on me  but on him that sent me  
45	and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me  
46	i am come a light into the world  that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness  
47	and if any man hear my words  and believe not  i judge him not  for i came not to judge the world  but to save the world  
48	he that rejecteth me  and receiveth not my words  hath one that judgeth him  the word that i have spoken  the same shall judge him in the last day  
49	for i have not spoken of myself  but the father which sent me  he gave me a commandment  what i should say  and what i should speak  
50	and i know that his commandment is life everlasting  whatsoever i speak therefore  even as the father said unto me  so i speak  
john 13
1 	now before the feast of the passover  when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father  having loved his own which were in the world  he loved them unto the end  
2	and supper being ended  the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot  simon s  son   to betray him  
3	jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands  and that he was come from god  and went to god  
4	he riseth from supper  and laid aside his garments  and took a towel  and girded himself  
5	after that he poureth water into a bason  and began to wash the disciples  feet  and to wipe  them  with the towel wherewith he was girded  
6	then cometh he to simon peter  and peter saith unto him  lord  dost thou wash my feet  
7	jesus answered and said unto him  what i do thou knowest not now  but thou shalt know hereafter  
8	peter saith unto him  thou shalt never wash my feet  jesus answered him  if i wash thee not  thou hast no part with me  
9	simon peter saith unto him  lord  not my feet only  but also  my  hands and  my  head  
10	jesus saith to him  he that is washed needeth not save to wash  his  feet  but is clean every whit  and ye are clean  but not all  
11	for he knew who should betray him  therefore said he  ye are not all clean  
12	so after he had washed their feet  and had taken his garments  and was set down again  he said unto them  know ye what i have done to you  
13	ye call me master and lord  and ye say well  for  so  i am  
14	if i then   your  lord and master  have washed your feet  ye also ought to wash one another s feet  
15	for i have given you an example  that ye should do as i have done to you  
16	verily  verily  i say unto you  the servant is not greater than his lord  neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him  
17	if ye know these things  happy are ye if ye do them  
18 	i speak not of you all  i know whom i have chosen  but that the scripture may be fulfilled  he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me  
19	now i tell you before it come  that  when it is come to pass  ye may believe that i am  he   
20	verily  verily  i say unto you  he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me  and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me  
21	when jesus had thus said  he was troubled in spirit  and testified  and said  verily  verily  i say unto you  that one of you shall betray me  
22	then the disciples looked one on another  doubting of whom he spake  
23	now there was leaning on jesus  bosom one of his disciples  whom jesus loved  
24	simon peter therefore beckoned to him  that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake  
25	he then lying on jesus  breast saith unto him  lord  who is it  
26	jesus answered  he it is  to whom i shall give a sop  when i have dipped  it   and when he had dipped the sop  he gave  it  to judas iscariot   the son  of simon  
27	and after the sop satan entered into him  then said jesus unto him  that thou doest  do quickly  
28	now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him  
29	for some  of them  thought  because judas had the bag  that jesus had said unto him  buy  those things  that we have need of against the feast  or  that he should give something to the poor  
30	he then having received the sop went immediately out  and it was night  
31 	therefore  when he was gone out  jesus said  now is the son of man glorified  and god is glorified in him  
32	if god be glorified in him  god shall also glorify him in himself  and shall straightway glorify him  
33	little children  yet a little while i am with you  ye shall seek me  and as i said unto the jews  whither i go  ye cannot come  so now i say to you  
34	a new commandment i give unto you  that ye love one another  as i have loved you  that ye also love one another  
35	by this shall all  men  know that ye are my disciples  if ye have love one to another  
36 	simon peter said unto him  lord  whither goest thou  jesus answered him  whither i go  thou canst not follow me now  but thou shalt follow me afterwards  
37	peter said unto him  lord  why cannot i follow thee now  i will lay down my life for thy sake  
38	jesus answered him  wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake  verily  verily  i say unto thee  the cock shall not crow  till thou hast denied me thrice  
john 14
1 	let not your heart be troubled  ye believe in god  believe also in me  
2	in my father s house are many mansions  if  it were  not  so   i would have told you  i go to prepare a place for you  
3	and if i go and prepare a place for you  i will come again  and receive you unto myself  that where i am   there  ye may be also  
4 	and whither i go ye know  and the way ye know  
5	thomas saith unto him  lord  we know not whither thou goest  and how can we know the way  
6	jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me  
7	if ye had known me  ye should have known my father also  and from henceforth ye know him  and have seen him  
8	philip saith unto him  lord  shew us the father  and it sufficeth us  
9	jesus saith unto him  have i been so long time with you  and yet hast thou not known me  philip  he that hath seen me hath seen the father  and how sayest thou  then   shew us the father  
10	believest thou not that i am in the father  and the father in me  the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself  but the father that dwelleth in me  he doeth the works  
11	believe me that i  am  in the father  and the father in me  or else believe me for the very works  sake  
12 	verily  verily  i say unto you  he that believeth on me  the works that i do shall he do also  and greater  works  than these shall he do  because i go unto my father  
13	and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name  that will i do  that the father may be glorified in the son  
14	if ye shall ask any thing in my name  i will do  it   
15 	if ye love me  keep my commandments  
16	and i will pray the father  and he shall give you another comforter  that he may abide with you for ever  
17	 even  the spirit of truth  whom the world cannot receive  because it seeth him not  neither knoweth him  but ye know him  for he dwelleth with you  and shall be in you  
18 	i will not leave you comfortless  i will come to you  
19	yet a little while  and the world seeth me no more  but ye see me  because i live  ye shall live also  
20	at that day ye shall know that i  am  in my father  and ye in me  and i in you  
21	he that hath my commandments  and keepeth them  he it is that loveth me  and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father  and i will love him  and will manifest myself to him  
22	judas saith unto him  not iscariot  lord  how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us  and not unto the world  
23	jesus answered and said unto him  if a man love me  he will keep my words  and my father will love him  and we will come unto him  and make our abode with him  
24	he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings  and the word which ye hear is not mine  but the father s which sent me  
25 	these things have i spoken unto you  being  yet  present with you  
26	but the comforter   which is  the holy ghost  whom the father will send in my name  he shall teach you all things  and bring all things to your remembrance  whatsoever i have said unto you  
27	peace i leave with you  my peace i give unto you  not as the world giveth  give i unto you  let not your heart be troubled  neither let it be afraid  
28 	ye have heard how i said unto you  i go away  and come  again  unto you  if ye loved me  ye would rejoice  because i said  i go unto the father  for my father is greater than i  
29	and now i have told you before it come to pass  that  when it is come to pass  ye might believe  
30	hereafter i will not talk much with you  for the prince of this world cometh  and hath nothing in me  
31	but that the world may know that i love the father  and as the father gave me commandment  even so i do  arise  let us go hence  
john 15
1 	i am the true vine  and my father is the husbandman  
2	every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away  and every  branch  that beareth fruit  he purgeth it  that it may bring forth more fruit  
3	now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you  
4	abide in me  and i in you  as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself  except it abide in the vine  no more can ye  except ye abide in me  
5	i am the vine  ye  are  the branches  he that abideth in me  and i in him  the same bringeth forth much fruit  for without me ye can do nothing  
6	if a man abide not in me  he is cast forth as a branch  and is withered  and men gather them  and cast  them  into the fire  and they are burned  
7	if ye abide in me  and my words abide in you  ye shall ask what ye will  and it shall be done unto you  
8	herein is my father glorified  that ye bear much fruit  so shall ye be my disciples  
9 	as the father hath loved me  so have i loved you  continue ye in my love  
10	if ye keep my commandments  ye shall abide in my love  even as i have kept my father s commandments  and abide in his love  
11	these things have i spoken unto you  that my joy might remain in you  and  that  your joy might be full  
12	this is my commandment  that ye love one another  as i have loved you  
13	greater love hath no man than this  that a man lay down his life for his friends  
14	ye are my friends  if ye do whatsoever i command you  
15	henceforth i call you not servants  for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth  but i have called you friends  for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you  
16	ye have not chosen me  but i have chosen you  and ordained you  that ye should go and bring forth fruit  and  that  your fruit should remain  that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name  he may give it you  
17	these things i command you  that ye love one another  
18 	if the world hate you  ye know that it hated me before  it hated  you  
19	if ye were of the world  the world would love his own  but because ye are not of the world  but i have chosen you out of the world  therefore the world hateth you  
20	remember the word that i said unto you  the servant is not greater than his lord  if they have persecuted me  they will also persecute you  if they have kept my saying  they will keep yours also  
21	but all these things will they do unto you for my name s sake  because they know not him that sent me  
22	if i had not come and spoken unto them  they had not had sin  but now they have no cloke for their sin  
23	he that hateth me hateth my father also  
24	if i had not done among them the works which none other man did  they had not had sin  but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father  
25	but  this cometh to pass   that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law  they hated me without a cause  
26 	but when the comforter is come  whom i will send unto you from the father   even  the spirit of truth  which proceedeth from the father  he shall testify of me  
27	and ye also shall bear witness  because ye have been with me from the beginning  
john 16
1 	these things have i spoken unto you  that ye should not be offended  
2	they shall put you out of the synagogues  yea  the time cometh  that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service  
3	and these things will they do unto you  because they have not known the father  nor me  
4	but these things have i told you  that when the time shall come  ye may remember that i told you of them  and these things i said not unto you at the beginning  because i was with you  
5	but now i go my way to him that sent me  and none of you asketh me  whither goest thou  
6	but because i have said these things unto you  sorrow hath filled your heart  
7 	nevertheless i tell you the truth  it is expedient for you that i go away  for if i go not away  the comforter will not come unto you  but if i depart  i will send him unto you  
8	and when he is come  he will reprove the world of sin  and of righteousness  and of judgment  
9	of sin  because they believe not on me  
10	of righteousness  because i go to my father  and ye see me no more  
11	of judgment  because the prince of this world is judged  
12	i have yet many things to say unto you  but ye cannot bear them now  
13	howbeit when he  the spirit of truth  is come  he will guide you into all truth  for he shall not speak of himself  but whatsoever he shall hear   that  shall he speak  and he will shew you things to come  
14	he shall glorify me  for he shall receive of mine  and shall shew  it  unto you  
15	all things that the father hath are mine  therefore said i  that he shall take of mine  and shall shew  it  unto you  
16 	a little while  and ye shall not see me  and again  a little while  and ye shall see me  because i go to the father  
17	then said  some  of his disciples among themselves  what is this that he saith unto us  a little while  and ye shall not see me  and again  a little while  and ye shall see me  and  because i go to the father  
18	they said therefore  what is this that he saith  a little while  we cannot tell what he saith  
19	now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him  and said unto them  do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said  a little while  and ye shall not see me  and again  a little while  and ye shall see me  
20	verily  verily  i say unto you  that ye shall weep and lament  but the world shall rejoice  and ye shall be sorrowful  but your sorrow shall be turned into joy  
21	a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow  because her hour is come  but as soon as she is delivered of the child  she remembereth no more the anguish  for joy that a man is born into the world  
22	and ye now therefore have sorrow  but i will see you again  and your heart shall rejoice  and your joy no man taketh from you  
23 	and in that day ye shall ask me nothing  verily  verily  i say unto you  whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name  he will give  it  you  
24	hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name  ask  and ye shall receive  that your joy may be full  
25	these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs  but the time cometh  when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs  but i shall shew you plainly of the father  
26	at that day ye shall ask in my name  and i say not unto you  that i will pray the father for you  
27	for the father himself loveth you  because ye have loved me  and have believed that i came out from god  
28 	i came forth from the father  and am come into the world  again  i leave the world  and go to the father  
29	his disciples said unto him  lo  now speakest thou plainly  and speakest no proverb  
30	now are we sure that thou knowest all things  and needest not that any man should ask thee  by this we believe that thou camest forth from god  
31	jesus answered them  do ye now believe  
32	behold  the hour cometh  yea  is now come  that ye shall be scattered  every man to his own  and shall leave me alone  and yet i am not alone  because the father is with me  
33	these things i have spoken unto you  that in me ye might have peace  in the world ye shall have tribulation  but be of good cheer  i have overcome the world  
john 17
1 	these words spake jesus  and lifted up his eyes to heaven  and said  father  the hour is come  glorify thy son  that thy son also may glorify thee  
2	as thou hast given him power over all flesh  that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him  
3	and this is life eternal  that they might know thee the only true god  and jesus christ  whom thou hast sent  
4	i have glorified thee on the earth  i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do  
5	and now  o father  glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was  
6 	i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world  thine they were  and thou gavest them me  and they have kept thy word  
7	now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee  
8	for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me  and they have received  them   and have known surely that i came out from thee  and they have believed that thou didst send me  
9	i pray for them  i pray not for the world  but for them which thou hast given me  for they are thine  
10	and all mine are thine  and thine are mine  and i am glorified in them  
11 	and now i am no more in the world  but these are in the world  and i come to thee  holy father  keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me  that they may be one  as we  are   
12	while i was with them in the world  i kept them in thy name  those that thou gavest me i have kept  and none of them is lost  but the son of perdition  that the scripture might be fulfilled  
13	and now come i to thee  and these things i speak in the world  that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves  
14	i have given them thy word  and the world hath hated them  because they are not of the world  even as i am not of the world  
15	i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world  but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil  
16	they are not of the world  even as i am not of the world  
17 	sanctify them through thy truth  thy word is truth  
18	as thou hast sent me into the world  even so have i also sent them into the world  
19	and for their sakes i sanctify myself  that they also might be sanctified through the truth  
20 	neither pray i for these alone  but for them also which shall believe on me through their word  
21	that they all may be one  as thou  father   art  in me  and i in thee  that they also may be one in us  that the world may believe that thou hast sent me  
22	and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them  that they may be one  even as we are one  
23	i in them  and thou in me  that they may be made perfect in one  and that the world may know that thou hast sent me  and hast loved them  as thou hast loved me  
24 	father  i will that they also  whom thou hast given me  be with me where i am  that they may behold my glory  which thou hast given me  for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world  
25	o righteous father  the world hath not known thee  but i have known thee  and these have known that thou hast sent me  
26	and i have declared unto them thy name  and will declare  it   that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them  and i in them  
john 18
1 	when jesus had spoken these words  he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron  where was a garden  into the which he entered  and his disciples  
2	and judas also  which betrayed him  knew the place  for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples  
3	judas then  having received a band  of men  and officers from the chief priests and pharisees  cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons  
4	jesus therefore  knowing all things that should come upon him  went forth  and said unto them  whom seek ye  
5	they answered him  jesus of nazareth  jesus saith unto them  i am  he   and judas also  which betrayed him  stood with them  
6	as soon then as he had said unto them  i am  he   they went backward  and fell to the ground  
7	then asked he them again  whom seek ye  and they said  jesus of nazareth  
8	jesus answered  i have told you that i am  he   if therefore ye seek me  let these go their way  
9	that the saying might be fulfilled  which he spake  of them which thou gavest me have i lost none  
10	then simon peter having a sword drew it  and smote the high priest s servant  and cut off his right ear  the servant s name was malchus  
11	then said jesus unto peter  put up thy sword into the sheath  the cup which my father hath given me  shall i not drink it  
12	then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus  and bound him  
13 	and led him away to annas first  for he was father in law to caiaphas  which was the high priest that same year  
14	now caiaphas was he  which gave counsel to the jews  that it was expedient that one man should die for the people  
15	and simon peter followed jesus  and  so did  another disciple  that disciple was known unto the high priest  and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest  
16	but peter stood at the door without  then went out that other disciple  which was known unto the high priest  and spake unto her that kept the door  and brought in peter  
17	then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter  art not thou also  one  of this man s disciples  he saith  i am not  
18	and the servants and officers stood there  who had made a fire of coals  for it was cold  and they warmed themselves  and peter stood with them  and warmed himself  
19	the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples  and of his doctrine  
20	jesus answered him  i spake openly to the world  i ever taught in the synagogue  and in the temple  whither the jews always resort  and in secret have i said nothing  
21	why askest thou me  ask them which heard me  what i have said unto them  behold  they know what i said  
22	and when he had thus spoken  one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand  saying  answerest thou the high priest so  
23	jesus answered him  if i have spoken evil  bear witness of the evil  but if well  why smitest thou me  
24	now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest  
25	and simon peter stood and warmed himself  they said therefore unto him  art not thou also  one  of his disciples  he denied  it   and said  i am not  
26	one of the servants of the high priest  being  his  kinsman whose ear peter cut off  saith  did not i see thee in the garden with him  
27	peter then denied again  and immediately the cock crew  
28 	then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment  and it was early  and they themselves went not into the judgment hall  lest they should be defiled  but that they might eat the passover  
29	pilate then went out unto them  and said  what accusation bring ye against this man  
30	they answered and said unto him  if he were not a malefactor  we would not have delivered him up unto thee  
31	then said pilate unto them  take ye him  and judge him according to your law  the jews therefore said unto him  it is not lawful for us to put any man to death  
32	that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled  which he spake  signifying what death he should die  
33	then pilate entered into the judgment hall again  and called jesus  and said unto him  art thou the king of the jews  
34	jesus answered him  sayest thou this thing of thyself  or did others tell it thee of me  
35	pilate answered  am i a jew  thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me  what hast thou done  
36	jesus answered  my kingdom is not of this world  if my kingdom were of this world  then would my servants fight  that i should not be delivered to the jews  but now is my kingdom not from hence  
37	pilate therefore said unto him  art thou a king then  jesus answered  thou sayest that i am a king  to this end was i born  and for this cause came i into the world  that i should bear witness unto the truth  every one that is of the truth heareth my voice  
38	pilate saith unto him  what is truth  and when he had said this  he went out again unto the jews  and saith unto them  i find in him no fault  at all   
39	but ye have a custom  that i should release unto you one at the passover  will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews  
40	then cried they all again  saying  not this man  but barabbas  now barabbas was a robber  
john 19
1 	then pilate therefore took jesus  and scourged  him   
2	and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns  and put  it  on his head  and they put on him a purple robe  
3	and said  hail  king of the jews  and they smote him with their hands  
4	pilate therefore went forth again  and saith unto them  behold  i bring him forth to you  that ye may know that i find no fault in him  
5	then came jesus forth  wearing the crown of thorns  and the purple robe  and  pilate  saith unto them  behold the man  
6	when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him  they cried out  saying  crucify  him   crucify  him   pilate saith unto them  take ye him  and crucify  him   for i find no fault in him  
7	the jews answered him  we have a law  and by our law he ought to die  because he made himself the son of god  
8	when pilate therefore heard that saying  he was the more afraid  
9	and went again into the judgment hall  and saith unto jesus  whence art thou  but jesus gave him no answer  
10	then saith pilate unto him  speakest thou not unto me  knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee  and have power to release thee  
11	jesus answered  thou couldest have no power  at all  against me  except it were given thee from above  therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin  
12	and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him  but the jews cried out  saying  if thou let this man go  thou art not caesar s friend  whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar  
13	when pilate therefore heard that saying  he brought jesus forth  and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement  but in the hebrew  gabbatha  
14	and it was the preparation of the passover  and about the sixth hour  and he saith unto the jews  behold your king  
15	but they cried out  away with  him   away with  him   crucify him  pilate saith unto them  shall i crucify your king  the chief priests answered  we have no king but caesar  
16 	then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified  and they took jesus  and led  him  away  
17	and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called  the place  of a skull  which is called in the hebrew golgotha  
18	where they crucified him  and two other with him  on either side one  and jesus in the midst  
19 	and pilate wrote a title  and put  it  on the cross  and the writing was  jesus of nazareth the king of the jews  
20	this title then read many of the jews  for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city  and it was written in hebrew   and  greek   and  latin  
21	then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate  write not  the king of the jews  but that he said  i am king of the jews  
22	pilate answered  what i have written i have written  
23	then the soldiers  when they had crucified jesus  took his garments  and made four parts  to every soldier a part  and also  his  coat  now the coat was without seam  woven from the top throughout  
24	they said therefore among themselves  let us not rend it  but cast lots for it  whose it shall be  that the scripture might be fulfilled  which saith  they parted my raiment among them  and for my vesture they did cast lots  these things therefore the soldiers did  
25	now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother  and his mother s sister  mary the  wife  of cleophas  and mary magdalene  
26	when jesus therefore saw his mother  and the disciple standing by  whom he loved  he saith unto his mother  woman  behold thy son  
27	then saith he to the disciple  behold thy mother  and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own  home   
28	after this  jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished  that the scripture might be fulfilled  saith  i thirst  
29	now there was set a vessel full of vinegar  and they filled a spunge with vinegar  and put  it  upon hyssop  and put  it  to his mouth  
30	when jesus therefore had received the vinegar  he said  it is finished  and he bowed his head  and gave up the ghost  
31 	the jews therefore  because it was the preparation  that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day   for that sabbath day was an high day   besought pilate that their legs might be broken  and  that  they might be taken away  
32	then came the soldiers  and brake the legs of the first  and of the other which was crucified with him  
33	but when they came to jesus  and saw that he was dead already  they brake not his legs  
34	but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side  and forthwith came there out blood and water  
35	and he that saw  it  bare record  and his record is true  and he knoweth that he saith true  that ye might believe  
36	for these things were done  that the scripture should be fulfilled  a bone of him shall not be broken  
37	and again another scripture saith  they shall look on him whom they pierced  
38 	and after this joseph of arimathaea  being a disciple of jesus  but secretly for fear of the jews  besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus  and pilate gave  him  leave  he came therefore  and took the body of jesus  
39	and there came also nicodemus  which at the first came to jesus by night  and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes  about an hundred pound  weight   
40	then took they the body of jesus  and wound it in linen clothes with the spices  as the manner of the jews is to bury  
41	now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden  and in the garden a new sepulchre  wherein was never man yet laid  
42	there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews  preparation  day   for the sepulchre was nigh at hand  
john 20
1 	the first  day  of the week cometh mary magdalene early  when it was yet dark  unto the sepulchre  and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre  
2	then she runneth  and cometh to simon peter  and to the other disciple  whom jesus loved  and saith unto them  they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre  and we know not where they have laid him  
3	peter therefore went forth  and that other disciple  and came to the sepulchre  
4	so they ran both together  and the other disciple did outrun peter  and came first to the sepulchre  
5	and he stooping down   and looking in   saw the linen clothes lying  yet went he not in  
6	then cometh simon peter following him  and went into the sepulchre  and seeth the linen clothes lie  
7	and the napkin  that was about his head  not lying with the linen clothes  but wrapped together in a place by itself  
8	then went in also that other disciple  which came first to the sepulchre  and he saw  and believed  
9	for as yet they knew not the scripture  that he must rise again from the dead  
10	then the disciples went away again unto their own home  
11 	but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping  and as she wept  she stooped down   and looked  into the sepulchre  
12	and seeth two angels in white sitting  the one at the head  and the other at the feet  where the body of jesus had lain  
13	and they say unto her  woman  why weepest thou  she saith unto them  because they have taken away my lord  and i know not where they have laid him  
14	and when she had thus said  she turned herself back  and saw jesus standing  and knew not that it was jesus  
15	jesus saith unto her  woman  why weepest thou  whom seekest thou  she  supposing him to be the gardener  saith unto him  sir  if thou have borne him hence  tell me where thou hast laid him  and i will take him away  
16	jesus saith unto her  mary  she turned herself  and saith unto him  rabboni  which is to say  master  
17	jesus saith unto her  touch me not  for i am not yet ascended to my father  but go to my brethren  and say unto them  i ascend unto my father  and your father  and  to  my god  and your god  
18	mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord  and  that  he had spoken these things unto her  
19 	then the same day at evening  being the first  day  of the week  when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews  came jesus and stood in the midst  and saith unto them  peace  be  unto you  
20	and when he had so said  he shewed unto them  his  hands and his side  then were the disciples glad  when they saw the lord  
21	then said jesus to them again  peace  be  unto you  as  my  father hath sent me  even so send i you  
22	and when he had said this  he breathed on  them   and saith unto them  receive ye the holy ghost  
23	whose soever sins ye remit  they are remitted unto them   and  whose soever  sins  ye retain  they are retained  
24	but thomas  one of the twelve  called didymus  was not with them when jesus came  
25	the other disciples therefore said unto him  we have seen the lord  but he said unto them  except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails  and put my finger into the print of the nails  and thrust my hand into his side  i will not believe  
26 	and after eight days again his disciples were within  and thomas with them   then  came jesus  the doors being shut  and stood in the midst  and said  peace  be  unto you  
27	then saith he to thomas  reach hither thy finger  and behold my hands  and reach hither thy hand  and thrust  it  into my side  and be not faithless  but believing  
28	and thomas answered and said unto him  my lord and my god  
29	jesus saith unto him  thomas  because thou hast seen me  thou hast believed  blessed  are  they that have not seen  and  yet  have believed  
30	and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples  which are not written in this book  
31	but these are written  that ye might believe that jesus is the christ  the son of god  and that believing ye might have life through his name  
john 21
1 	after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias  and on this wise shewed he  himself   
2	there were together simon peter  and thomas called didymus  and nathanael of cana in galilee  and the  sons  of zebedee  and two other of his disciples  
3	simon peter saith unto them  i go a fishing  they say unto him  we also go with thee  they went forth  and entered into a ship immediately  and that night they caught nothing  
4	but when the morning was now come  jesus stood on the shore  but the disciples knew not that it was jesus  
5	then jesus saith unto them  children  have ye any meat  they answered him  no  
6	and he said unto them  cast the net on the right side of the ship  and ye shall find  they cast therefore  and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes  
7	therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter  it is the lord  now when simon peter heard that it was the lord  he girt  his  fisher s coat  unto him    for he was naked   and did cast himself into the sea  
8	and the other disciples came in a little ship   for they were not far from land  but as it were two hundred cubits   dragging the net with fishes  
9	as soon then as they were come to land  they saw a fire of coals there  and fish laid thereon  and bread  
10	jesus saith unto them  bring of the fish which ye have now caught  
11	simon peter went up  and drew the net to land full of great fishes  an hundred and fifty and three  and for all there were so many  yet was not the net broken  
12	jesus saith unto them  come  and  dine  and none of the disciples durst ask him  who art thou  knowing that it was the lord  
13	jesus then cometh  and taketh bread  and giveth them  and fish likewise  
14	this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples  after that he was risen from the dead  
15 	so when they had dined  jesus saith to simon peter  simon   son  of jonas  lovest thou me more than these  he saith unto him  yea  lord  thou knowest that i love thee  he saith unto him  feed my lambs  
16	he saith to him again the second time  simon   son  of jonas  lovest thou me  he saith unto him  yea  lord  thou knowest that i love thee  he saith unto him  feed my sheep  
17	he saith unto him the third time  simon   son  of jonas  lovest thou me  peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time  lovest thou me  and he said unto him  lord  thou knowest all things  thou knowest that i love thee  jesus saith unto him  feed my sheep  
18	verily  verily  i say unto thee  when thou wast young  thou girdedst thyself  and walkedst whither thou wouldest  but when thou shalt be old  thou shalt stretch forth thy hands  and another shall gird thee  and carry  thee  whither thou wouldest not  
19	this spake he  signifying by what death he should glorify god  and when he had spoken this  he saith unto him  follow me  
20 	then peter  turning about  seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following  which also leaned on his breast at supper  and said  lord  which is he that betrayeth thee  
21	peter seeing him saith to jesus  lord  and what  shall  this man  do   
22	jesus saith unto him  if i will that he tarry till i come  what  is that  to thee  follow thou me  
23	then went this saying abroad among the brethren  that that disciple should not die  yet jesus said not unto him  he shall not die  but  if i will that he tarry till i come  what  is that  to thee  
24	this is the disciple which testifieth of these things  and wrote these things  and we know that his testimony is true  
25	and there are also many other things which jesus did  the which  if they should be written every one  i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written  amen  

the acts of the apostles
acts 1
1 	the former treatise have i made  o theophilus  of all that jesus began both to do and teach  
2	until the day in which he was taken up  after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen  
3	to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs  being seen of them forty days  and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god  
4	and  being assembled together with  them   commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem  but wait for the promise of the father  which   saith he   ye have heard of me  
5	for john truly baptized with water  but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence  
6 	when they therefore were come together  they asked of him  saying  lord  wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel  
7	and he said unto them  it is not for you to know the times or the seasons  which the father hath put in his own power  
8	but ye shall receive power  after that the holy ghost is come upon you  and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem  and in all judaea  and in samaria  and unto the uttermost part of the earth  
9	and when he had spoken these things  while they beheld  he was taken up  and a cloud received him out of their sight  
10	and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up  behold  two men stood by them in white apparel  
11	which also said  ye men of galilee  why stand ye gazing up into heaven  this same jesus  which is taken up from you into heaven  shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven  
12 	then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet  which is from jerusalem a sabbath day s journey  
13	and when they were come in  they went up into an upper room  where abode both peter  and james  and john  and andrew  philip  and thomas  bartholomew  and matthew  james  the son  of alphaeus  and simon zelotes  and judas  the brother  of james  
14	these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication  with the women  and mary the mother of jesus  and with his brethren  
15 	and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples  and said   the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty   
16	men  and  brethren  this scripture must needs have been fulfilled  which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas  which was guide to them that took jesus  
17	for he was numbered with us  and had obtained part of this ministry  
18	now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity  and falling headlong  he burst asunder in the midst  and all his bowels gushed out  
19	and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem  insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue  aceldama  that is to say  the field of blood  
20	for it is written in the book of psalms  let his habitation be desolate  and let no man dwell therein  and his bishoprick let another take  
21	wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us  
22	beginning from the baptism of john  unto that same day that he was taken up from us  must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection  
23	and they appointed two  joseph called barsabas  who was surnamed justus  and matthias  
24	and they prayed  and said  thou  lord  which knowest the hearts of all  men   shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  
25	that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship  from which judas by transgression fell  that he might go to his own place  
26	and they gave forth their lots  and the lot fell upon matthias  and he was numbered with the eleven apostles  
acts 2
1 	and when the day of pentecost was fully come  they were all with one accord in one place  
2	and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind  and it filled all the house where they were sitting  
3	and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire  and it sat upon each of them  
4	and they were all filled with the holy ghost  and began to speak with other tongues  as the spirit gave them utterance  
5 	and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews  devout men  out of every nation under heaven  
6	now when this was noised abroad  the multitude came together  and were confounded  because that every man heard them speak in his own language  
7	and they were all amazed and marvelled  saying one to another  behold  are not all these which speak galilaeans  
8	and how hear we every man in our own tongue  wherein we were born  
9	parthians  and medes  and elamites  and the dwellers in mesopotamia  and in judaea  and cappadocia  in pontus  and asia  
10	phrygia  and pamphylia  in egypt  and in the parts of libya about cyrene  and strangers of rome  jews and proselytes  
11	cretes and arabians  we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god  
12	and they were all amazed  and were in doubt  saying one to another  what meaneth this  
13	others mocking said  these men are full of new wine  
14 	but peter  standing up with the eleven  lifted up his voice  and said unto them  ye men of judaea  and all  ye  that dwell at jerusalem  be this known unto you  and hearken to my words  
15	for these are not drunken  as ye suppose  seeing it is  but  the third hour of the day  
16	but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel  
17	and it shall come to pass in the last days  saith god  i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh  and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy  and your young men shall see visions  and your old men shall dream dreams  
18	and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit  and they shall prophesy  
19	and i will shew wonders in heaven above  and signs in the earth beneath  blood  and fire  and vapour of smoke  
20	the sun shall be turned into darkness  and the moon into blood  before that great and notable day of the lord come  
21	and it shall come to pass   that  whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved  
22	ye men of israel  hear these words  jesus of nazareth  a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs  which god did by him in the midst of you  as ye yourselves also know  
23	him  being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god  ye have taken  and by wicked hands have crucified and slain  
24	whom god hath raised up  having loosed the pains of death  because it was not possible that he should be holden of it  
25	for david speaketh concerning him  i foresaw the lord always before my face  for he is on my right hand  that i should not be moved  
26	therefore did my heart rejoice  and my tongue was glad  moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope  
27	because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell  neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption  
28	thou hast made known to me the ways of life  thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance  
29	men  and  brethren  let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david  that he is both dead and buried  and his sepulchre is with us unto this day  
30	therefore being a prophet  and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him  that of the fruit of his loins  according to the flesh  he would raise up christ to sit on his throne  
31	he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ  that his soul was not left in hell  neither his flesh did see corruption  
32	this jesus hath god raised up  whereof we all are witnesses  
33	therefore being by the right hand of god exalted  and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost  he hath shed forth this  which ye now see and hear  
34	for david is not ascended into the heavens  but he saith himself  the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  
35	until i make thy foes thy footstool  
36	therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly  that god hath made that same jesus  whom ye have crucified  both lord and christ  
37 	now when they heard  this   they were pricked in their heart  and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles  men  and  brethren  what shall we do  
38	then peter said unto them  repent  and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins  and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost  
39	for the promise is unto you  and to your children  and to all that are afar off   even  as many as the lord our god shall call  
40	and with many other words did he testify and exhort  saying  save yourselves from this untoward generation  
41	then they that gladly received his word were baptized  and the same day there were added  unto them  about three thousand souls  
42 	and they continued stedfastly in the apostles  doctrine and fellowship  and in breaking of bread  and in prayers  
43	and fear came upon every soul  and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles  
44	and all that believed were together  and had all things common  
45	and sold their possessions and goods  and parted them to all  men   as every man had need  
46	and they  continuing daily with one accord in the temple  and breaking bread from house to house  did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart  
47	praising god  and having favour with all the people  and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved  
acts 3
1 	now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer   being  the ninth  hour   
2	and a certain man lame from his mother s womb was carried  whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful  to ask alms of them that entered into the temple  
3	who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms  
4	and peter  fastening his eyes upon him with john  said  look on us  
5	and he gave heed unto them  expecting to receive something of them  
6	then peter said  silver and gold have i none  but such as i have give i thee  in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk  
7	and he took him by the right hand  and lifted  him  up  and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength  
8	and he leaping up stood  and walked  and entered with them into the temple  walking  and leaping  and praising god  
9	and all the people saw him walking and praising god  
10	and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple  and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him  
11	and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john  all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon s  greatly wondering  
12 	and when peter saw  it   he answered unto the people  ye men of israel  why marvel ye at this  or why look ye so earnestly on us  as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk  
13	the god of abraham  and of isaac  and of jacob  the god of our fathers  hath glorified his son jesus  whom ye delivered up  and denied him in the presence of pilate  when he was determined to let  him  go  
14	but ye denied the holy one and the just  and desired a murderer to be granted unto you  
15	and killed the prince of life  whom god hath raised from the dead  whereof we are witnesses  
16	and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong  whom ye see and know  yea  the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all  
17	and now  brethren  i wot that through ignorance ye did  it   as  did  also your rulers  
18	but those things  which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets  that christ should suffer  he hath so fulfilled  
19	repent ye therefore  and be converted  that your sins may be blotted out  when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord  
20	and he shall send jesus christ  which before was preached unto you  
21	whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things  which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began  
22	for moses truly said unto the fathers  a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren  like unto me  him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you  
23	and it shall come to pass   that  every soul  which will not hear that prophet  shall be destroyed from among the people  
24	yea  and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after  as many as have spoken  have likewise foretold of these days  
25	ye are the children of the prophets  and of the covenant which god made with our fathers  saying unto abraham  and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed  
26	unto you first god  having raised up his son jesus  sent him to bless you  in turning away every one of you from his iniquities  
acts 4
1 	and as they spake unto the people  the priests  and the captain of the temple  and the sadducees  came upon them  
2	being grieved that they taught the people  and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead  
3	and they laid hands on them  and put  them  in hold unto the next day  for it was now eventide  
4	howbeit many of them which heard the word believed  and the number of the men was about five thousand  
5 	and it came to pass on the morrow  that their rulers  and elders  and scribes  
6	and annas the high priest  and caiaphas  and john  and alexander  and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest  were gathered together at jerusalem  
7	and when they had set them in the midst  they asked  by what power  or by what name  have ye done this  
8	then peter  filled with the holy ghost  said unto them  ye rulers of the people  and elders of israel  
9	if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man  by what means he is made whole  
10	be it known unto you all  and to all the people of israel  that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth  whom ye crucified  whom god raised from the dead   even  by him doth this man stand here before you whole  
11	this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders  which is become the head of the corner  
12	neither is there salvation in any other  for there is none other name under heaven given among men  whereby we must be saved  
13	now when they saw the boldness of peter and john  and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men  they marvelled  and they took knowledge of them  that they had been with jesus  
14	and beholding the man which was healed standing with them  they could say nothing against it  
15 	but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council  they conferred among themselves  
16	saying  what shall we do to these men  for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them  is  manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem  and we cannot deny  it   
17	but that it spread no further among the people  let us straitly threaten them  that they speak henceforth to no man in this name  
18	and they called them  and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus  
19	but peter and john answered and said unto them  whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god  judge ye  
20	for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard  
21	so when they had further threatened them  they let them go  finding nothing how they might punish them  because of the people  for all  men  glorified god for that which was done  
22	for the man was above forty years old  on whom this miracle of healing was shewed  
23 	and being let go  they went to their own company  and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them  
24	and when they heard that  they lifted up their voice to god with one accord  and said  lord  thou  art  god  which hast made heaven  and earth  and the sea  and all that in them is  
25	who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said  why did the heathen rage  and the people imagine vain things  
26	the kings of the earth stood up  and the rulers were gathered together against the lord  and against his christ  
27	for of a truth against thy holy child jesus  whom thou hast anointed  both herod  and pontius pilate  with the gentiles  and the people of israel  were gathered together  
28	for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done  
29	and now  lord  behold their threatenings  and grant unto thy servants  that with all boldness they may speak thy word  
30	by stretching forth thine hand to heal  and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus  
31	and when they had prayed  the place was shaken where they were assembled together  and they were all filled with the holy ghost  and they spake the word of god with boldness  
32 	and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul  neither said any  of them  that ought of the things which he possessed was his own  but they had all things common  
33	and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus  and great grace was upon them all  
34	neither was there any among them that lacked  for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them  and brought the prices of the things that were sold  
35	and laid  them  down at the apostles  feet  and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need  
36	and joses  who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas   which is  being interpreted  the son of consolation   a levite   and  of the country of cyprus  
37	having land  sold  it   and brought the money  and laid  it  at the apostles  feet  
acts 5
1 	but a certain man named ananias  with sapphira his wife  sold a possession  
2	and kept back  part  of the price  his wife also being privy  to it   and brought a certain part  and laid  it  at the apostles  feet  
3	but peter said  ananias  why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost  and to keep back  part  of the price of the land  
4	whiles it remained  was it not thine own  and after it was sold  was it not in thine own power  why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart  thou hast not lied unto men  but unto god  
5	and ananias hearing these words fell down  and gave up the ghost  and great fear came on all them that heard these things  
6	and the young men arose  wound him up  and carried  him  out  and buried  him   
7	and it was about the space of three hours after  when his wife  not knowing what was done  came in  
8	and peter answered unto her  tell me whether ye sold the land for so much  and she said  yea  for so much  
9	then peter said unto her  how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord  behold  the feet of them which have buried thy husband  are  at the door  and shall carry thee out  
10	then fell she down straightway at his feet  and yielded up the ghost  and the young men came in  and found her dead  and  carrying  her  forth  buried  her  by her husband  
11	and great fear came upon all the church  and upon as many as heard these things  
12 	and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people   and they were all with one accord in solomon s porch  
13	and of the rest durst no man join himself to them  but the people magnified them  
14	and believers were the more added to the lord  multitudes both of men and women   
15	insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets  and laid  them  on beds and couches  that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them  
16	there came also a multitude  out  of the cities round about unto jerusalem  bringing sick folks  and them which were vexed with unclean spirits  and they were healed every one  
17 	then the high priest rose up  and all they that were with him   which is the sect of the sadducees   and were filled with indignation  
18	and laid their hands on the apostles  and put them in the common prison  
19	but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors  and brought them forth  and said  
20	go  stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life  
21	and when they heard  that   they entered into the temple early in the morning  and taught  but the high priest came  and they that were with him  and called the council together  and all the senate of the children of israel  and sent to the prison to have them brought  
22	but when the officers came  and found them not in the prison  they returned  and told  
23	saying  the prison truly found we shut with all safety  and the keepers standing without before the doors  but when we had opened  we found no man within  
24	now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things  they doubted of them whereunto this would grow  
25	then came one and told them  saying  behold  the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple  and teaching the people  
26 	then went the captain with the officers  and brought them without violence  for they feared the people  lest they should have been stoned  
27	and when they had brought them  they set  them  before the council  and the high priest asked them  
28	saying  did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name  and  behold  ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine  and intend to bring this man s blood upon us  
29	then peter and the  other  apostles answered and said  we ought to obey god rather than men  
30	the god of our fathers raised up jesus  whom ye slew and hanged on a tree  
31	him hath god exalted with his right hand  to be  a prince and a saviour  for to give repentance to israel  and forgiveness of sins  
32	and we are his witnesses of these things  and  so is  also the holy ghost  whom god hath given to them that obey him  
33	when they heard  that   they were cut  to the heart   and took counsel to slay them  
34	then stood there up one in the council  a pharisee  named gamaliel  a doctor of the law  had in reputation among all the people  and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space  
35	and said unto them  ye men of israel  take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men  
36	for before these days rose up theudas  boasting himself to be somebody  to whom a number of men  about four hundred  joined themselves  who was slain  and all  as many as obeyed him  were scattered  and brought to nought  
37	after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing  and drew away much people after him  he also perished  and all   even  as many as obeyed him  were dispersed  
38	and now i say unto you  refrain from these men  and let them alone  for if this counsel or this work be of men  it will come to nought  
39	but if it be of god  ye cannot overthrow it  lest haply ye be found even to fight against god  
40	and to him they agreed  and when they had called the apostles  and beaten  them   they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus  and let them go  
41	and they departed from the presence of the council  rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name  
42	and daily in the temple  and in every house  they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ  
acts 6
1 	and in those days  when the number of the disciples was multiplied  there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews  because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration  
2	then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples  unto them   and said  it is not reason that we should leave the word of god  and serve tables  
3	wherefore  brethren  look ye out among you seven men of honest report  full of the holy ghost and wisdom  whom we may appoint over this business  
4	but we will give ourselves continually to prayer  and to the ministry of the word  
5	and the saying pleased the whole multitude  and they chose stephen  a man full of faith and of the holy ghost  and philip  and prochorus  and nicanor  and timon  and parmenas  and nicolas a proselyte of antioch  
6	whom they set before the apostles  and when they had prayed  they laid  their  hands on them  
7	and the word of god increased  and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly  and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith  
8 	and stephen  full of faith and power  did great wonders and miracles among the people  
9	then there arose certain of the synagogue  which is called  the synagogue  of the libertines  and cyrenians  and alexandrians  and of them of cilicia and of asia  disputing with stephen  
10	and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake  
11	then they suborned men  which said  we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses  and  against  god  
12	and they stirred up the people  and the elders  and the scribes  and came upon  him   and caught him  and brought  him  to the council  
13	and set up false witnesses  which said  this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place  and the law  
14	for we have heard him say  that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place  and shall change the customs which moses delivered us  
15	and all that sat in the council  looking stedfastly on him  saw his face as it had been the face of an angel  
acts 7
1 	then said the high priest  are these things so  
2	and he said  men  brethren  and fathers  hearken  the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham  when he was in mesopotamia  before he dwelt in charran  
3	and said unto him  get thee out of thy country  and from thy kindred  and come into the land which i shall shew thee  
4	then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans  and dwelt in charran  and from thence  when his father was dead  he removed him into this land  wherein ye now dwell  
5	and he gave him none inheritance in it  no  not  so much as  to set his foot on  yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession  and to his seed after him  when  as yet  he had no child  
6	and god spake on this wise  that his seed should sojourn in a strange land  and that they should bring them into bondage  and entreat  them  evil four hundred years  
7	and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge  said god  and after that shall they come forth  and serve me in this place  
8	and he gave him the covenant of circumcision  and so  abraham  begat isaac  and circumcised him the eighth day  and isaac  begat  jacob  and jacob  begat  the twelve patriarchs  
9	and the patriarchs  moved with envy  sold joseph into egypt  but god was with him  
10	and delivered him out of all his afflictions  and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt  and he made him governor over egypt and all his house  
11	now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan  and great affliction  and our fathers found no sustenance  
12	but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt  he sent out our fathers first  
13	and at the second  time  joseph was made known to his brethren  and joseph s kindred was made known unto pharaoh  
14	then sent joseph  and called his father jacob to  him   and all his kindred  threescore and fifteen souls  
15	so jacob went down into egypt  and died  he  and our fathers  
16	and were carried over into sychem  and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor  the father  of sychem  
17 	but when the time of the promise drew nigh  which god had sworn to abraham  the people grew and multiplied in egypt  
18	till another king arose  which knew not joseph  
19	the same dealt subtilly with our kindred  and evil entreated our fathers  so that they cast out their young children  to the end they might not live  
20	in which time moses was born  and was exceeding fair  and nourished up in his father s house three months  
21	and when he was cast out  pharaoh s daughter took him up  and nourished him for her own son  
22	and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians  and was mighty in words and in deeds  
23	and when he was full forty years old  it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel  
24	and seeing one  of them  suffer wrong  he defended  him   and avenged him that was oppressed  and smote the egyptian  
25	for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them  but they understood not  
26	and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove  and would have set them at one again  saying  sirs  ye are brethren  why do ye wrong one to another  
27	but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away  saying  who made thee a ruler and a judge over us  
28	wilt thou kill me  as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday  
29	then fled moses at this saying  and was a stranger in the land of madian  where he begat two sons  
30 	and when forty years were expired  there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush  
31	when moses saw  it   he wondered at the sight  and as he drew near to behold  it   the voice of the lord came unto him  
32	 saying   i  am  the god of thy fathers  the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  then moses trembled  and durst not behold  
33	then said the lord to him  put off thy shoes from thy feet  for the place where thou standest is holy ground  
34	i have seen  i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt  and i have heard their groaning  and am come down to deliver them  and now come  i will send thee into egypt  
35	this moses whom they refused  saying  who made thee a ruler and a judge  the same did god send  to be  a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush  
36	he brought them out  after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt  and in the red sea  and in the wilderness forty years  
37	this is that moses  which said unto the children of israel  a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren  like unto me  him shall ye hear  
38	this is he  that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina  and  with  our fathers  who received the lively oracles to give unto us  
39	to whom our fathers would not obey  but thrust  him  from them  and in their hearts turned back again into egypt  
40	saying unto aaron  make us gods to go before us  for  as for  this moses  which brought us out of the land of egypt  we wot not what is become of him  
41	and they made a calf in those days  and offered sacrifice unto the idol  and rejoiced in the works of their own hands  
42 	then god turned  and gave them up to worship the host of heaven  as it is written in the book of the prophets  o ye house of israel  have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices  by the space of  forty years in the wilderness  
43	yea  ye took up the tabernacle of moloch  and the star of your god remphan  figures which ye made to worship them  and i will carry you away beyond babylon  
44	our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness  as he had appointed  speaking unto moses  that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen  
45	which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles  whom god drave out before the face of our fathers  unto the days of david  
46	who found favour before god  and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob  
47	but solomon built him an house  
48	howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands  as saith the prophet  
49	heaven  is  my throne  and earth  is  my footstool  what house will ye build me  saith the lord  or what  is  the place of my rest  
50	hath not my hand made all these things  
51 	ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears  ye do always resist the holy ghost  as your fathers  did   so  do  ye  
52	which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted  and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one  of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers  
53	who have received the law by the disposition of angels  and have not kept  it   
54 	when they heard these things  they were cut to the heart  and they gnashed on him with  their  teeth  
55	but he  being full of the holy ghost  looked up stedfastly into heaven  and saw the glory of god  and jesus standing on the right hand of god  
56	and said  behold  i see the heavens opened  and the son of man standing on the right hand of god  
57	then they cried out with a loud voice  and stopped their ears  and ran upon him with one accord  
58	and cast  him  out of the city  and stoned  him   and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man s feet  whose name was saul  
59	and they stoned stephen  calling upon  god   and saying  lord jesus  receive my spirit  
60	and he kneeled down  and cried with a loud voice  lord  lay not this sin to their charge  and when he had said this  he fell asleep  
acts 8
1 	and saul was consenting unto his death  and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem  and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria  except the apostles  
2	and devout men carried stephen  to his burial   and made great lamentation over him  
3	as for saul  he made havock of the church  entering into every house  and haling men and women committed  them  to prison  
4 	therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word  
5	then philip went down to the city of samaria  and preached christ unto them  
6	and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake  hearing and seeing the miracles which he did  
7	for unclean spirits  crying with loud voice  came out of many that were possessed  with them   and many taken with palsies  and that were lame  were healed  
8	and there was great joy in that city  
9	but there was a certain man  called simon  which beforetime in the same city used sorcery  and bewitched the people of samaria  giving out that himself was some great one  
10	to whom they all gave heed  from the least to the greatest  saying  this man is the great power of god  
11	and to him they had regard  because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries  
12	but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god  and the name of jesus christ  they were baptized  both men and women  
13	then simon himself believed also  and when he was baptized  he continued with philip  and wondered  beholding the miracles and signs which were done  
14 	now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god  they sent unto them peter and john  
15	who  when they were come down  prayed for them  that they might receive the holy ghost  
16	 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them  only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus   
17	then laid they  their  hands on them  and they received the holy ghost  
18	and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles  hands the holy ghost was given  he offered them money  
19	saying  give me also this power  that on whomsoever i lay hands  he may receive the holy ghost  
20	but peter said unto him  thy money perish with thee  because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money  
21	thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter  for thy heart is not right in the sight of god  
22	repent therefore of this thy wickedness  and pray god  if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee  
23	for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness  and  in  the bond of iniquity  
24	then answered simon  and said  pray ye to the lord for me  that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me  
25	and they  when they had testified and preached the word of the lord  returned to jerusalem  and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans  
26 	and the angel of the lord spake unto philip  saying  arise  and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza  which is desert  
27	and he arose and went  and  behold  a man of ethiopia  an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians  who had the charge of all her treasure  and had come to jerusalem for to worship  
28	was returning  and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet  
29	then the spirit said unto philip  go near  and join thyself to this chariot  
30	and philip ran thither to  him   and heard him read the prophet esaias  and said  understandest thou what thou readest  
31	and he said  how can i  except some man should guide me  and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him  
32	the place of the scripture which he read was this  he was led as a sheep to the slaughter  and like a lamb dumb before his shearer  so opened he not his mouth  
33	in his humiliation his judgment was taken away  and who shall declare his generation  for his life is taken from the earth  
34	and the eunuch answered philip  and said  i pray thee  of whom speaketh the prophet this  of himself  or of some other man  
35	then philip opened his mouth  and began at the same scripture  and preached unto him jesus  
36	and as they went on  their  way  they came unto a certain water  and the eunuch said  see   here is  water  what doth hinder me to be baptized  
37	and philip said  if thou believest with all thine heart  thou mayest  and he answered and said  i believe that jesus christ is the son of god  
38	and he commanded the chariot to stand still  and they went down both into the water  both philip and the eunuch  and he baptized him  
39	and when they were come up out of the water  the spirit of the lord caught away philip  that the eunuch saw him no more  and he went on his way rejoicing  
40	but philip was found at azotus  and passing through he preached in all the cities  till he came to caesarea  
acts 9
1 	and saul  yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord  went unto the high priest  
2	and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues  that if he found any of this way  whether they were men or women  he might bring them bound unto jerusalem  
3	and as he journeyed  he came near damascus  and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven  
4	and he fell to the earth  and heard a voice saying unto him  saul  saul  why persecutest thou me  
5	and he said  who art thou  lord  and the lord said  i am jesus whom thou persecutest   it is  hard for thee to kick against the pricks  
6	and he trembling and astonished said  lord  what wilt thou have me to do  and the lord  said  unto him  arise  and go into the city  and it shall be told thee what thou must do  
7	and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless  hearing a voice  but seeing no man  
8	and saul arose from the earth  and when his eyes were opened  he saw no man  but they led him by the hand  and brought  him  into damascus  
9	and he was three days without sight  and neither did eat nor drink  
10 	and there was a certain disciple at damascus  named ananias  and to him said the lord in a vision  ananias  and he said  behold  i  am here   lord  
11	and the lord  said  unto him  arise  and go into the street which is called straight  and enquire in the house of judas for  one  called saul  of tarsus  for  behold  he prayeth  
12	and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in  and putting  his  hand on him  that he might receive his sight  
13	then ananias answered  lord  i have heard by many of this man  how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem  
14	and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name  
15	but the lord said unto him  go thy way  for he is a chosen vessel unto me  to bear my name before the gentiles  and kings  and the children of israel  
16	for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name s sake  
17	and ananias went his way  and entered into the house  and putting his hands on him said  brother saul  the lord   even  jesus  that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest  hath sent me  that thou mightest receive thy sight  and be filled with the holy ghost  
18	and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales  and he received sight forthwith  and arose  and was baptized  
19	and when he had received meat  he was strengthened  then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus  
20	and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues  that he is the son of god  
21	but all that heard  him  were amazed  and said  is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem  and came hither for that intent  that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests  
22	but saul increased the more in strength  and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus  proving that this is very christ  
23 	and after that many days were fulfilled  the jews took counsel to kill him  
24	but their laying await was known of saul  and they watched the gates day and night to kill him  
25	then the disciples took him by night  and let  him  down by the wall in a basket  
26	and when saul was come to jerusalem  he assayed to join himself to the disciples  but they were all afraid of him  and believed not that he was a disciple  
27	but barnabas took him  and brought  him  to the apostles  and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way  and that he had spoken to him  and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus  
28	and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem  
29	and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus  and disputed against the grecians  but they went about to slay him  
30	 which  when the brethren knew  they brought him down to caesarea  and sent him forth to tarsus  
31	then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria  and were edified  and walking in the fear of the lord  and in the comfort of the holy ghost  were multiplied  
32 	and it came to pass  as peter passed throughout all  quarters   he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda  
33	and there he found a certain man named aeneas  which had kept his bed eight years  and was sick of the palsy  
34	and peter said unto him  aeneas  jesus christ maketh thee whole  arise  and make thy bed  and he arose immediately  
35	and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him  and turned to the lord  
36 	now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha  which by interpretation is called dorcas  this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did  
37	and it came to pass in those days  that she was sick  and died  whom when they had washed  they laid  her  in an upper chamber  
38	and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa  and the disciples had heard that peter was there  they sent unto him two men  desiring  him  that he would not delay to come to them  
39	then peter arose and went with them  when he was come  they brought him into the upper chamber  and all the widows stood by him weeping  and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made  while she was with them  
40	but peter put them all forth  and kneeled down  and prayed  and turning  him  to the body said  tabitha  arise  and she opened her eyes  and when she saw peter  she sat up  
41	and he gave her  his  hand  and lifted her up  and when he had called the saints and widows  presented her alive  
42	and it was known throughout all joppa  and many believed in the lord  
43	and it came to pass  that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner  
acts 10
1 	there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius  a centurion of the band called the italian  band   
2	 a  devout  man   and one that feared god with all his house  which gave much alms to the people  and prayed to god alway  
3	he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him  and saying unto him  cornelius  
4	and when he looked on him  he was afraid  and said  what is it  lord  and he said unto him  thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god  
5	and now send men to joppa  and call for  one  simon  whose surname is peter  
6	he lodgeth with one simon a tanner  whose house is by the sea side  he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do  
7	and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed  he called two of his household servants  and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually  
8	and when he had declared all  these  things unto them  he sent them to joppa  
9 	on the morrow  as they went on their journey  and drew nigh unto the city  peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour  
10	and he became very hungry  and would have eaten  but while they made ready  he fell into a trance  
11	and saw heaven opened  and a certain vessel descending unto him  as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners  and let down to the earth  
12	wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth  and wild beasts  and creeping things  and fowls of the air  
13	and there came a voice to him  rise  peter  kill  and eat  
14	but peter said  not so  lord  for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean  
15	and the voice  spake  unto him again the second time  what god hath cleansed   that  call not thou common  
16	this was done thrice  and the vessel was received up again into heaven  
17	now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean  behold  the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simon s house  and stood before the gate  
18	and called  and asked whether simon  which was surnamed peter  were lodged there  
19 	while peter thought on the vision  the spirit said unto him  behold  three men seek thee  
20	arise therefore  and get thee down  and go with them  doubting nothing  for i have sent them  
21	then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius  and said  behold  i am he whom ye seek  what  is  the cause wherefore ye are come  
22	and they said  cornelius the centurion  a just man  and one that feareth god  and of good report among all the nation of the jews  was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house  and to hear words of thee  
23	then called he them in  and lodged  them   and on the morrow peter went away with them  and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him  
24	and the morrow after they entered into caesarea  and cornelius waited for them  and had called together his kinsmen and near friends  
25	and as peter was coming in  cornelius met him  and fell down at his feet  and worshipped  him   
26	but peter took him up  saying  stand up  i myself also am a man  
27	and as he talked with him  he went in  and found many that were come together  
28	and he said unto them  ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company  or come unto one of another nation  but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean  
29	therefore came i  unto you  without gainsaying  as soon as i was sent for  i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me  
30	and cornelius said  four days ago i was fasting until this hour  and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house  and  behold  a man stood before me in bright clothing  
31	and said  cornelius  thy prayer is heard  and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god  
32	send therefore to joppa  and call hither simon  whose surname is peter  he is lodged in the house of  one  simon a tanner by the sea side  who  when he cometh  shall speak unto thee  
33	immediately therefore i sent to thee  and thou hast well done that thou art come  now therefore are we all here present before god  to hear all things that are commanded thee of god  
34 	then peter opened  his  mouth  and said  of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons  
35	but in every nation he that feareth him  and worketh righteousness  is accepted with him  
36	the word which  god  sent unto the children of israel  preaching peace by jesus christ   he is lord of all   
37	that word   i say   ye know  which was published throughout all judaea  and began from galilee  after the baptism which john preached  
38	how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power  who went about doing good  and healing all that were oppressed of the devil  for god was with him  
39	and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews  and in jerusalem  whom they slew and hanged on a tree  
40	him god raised up the third day  and shewed him openly  
41	not to all the people  but unto witnesses chosen before of god   even  to us  who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead  
42	and he commanded us to preach unto the people  and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god  to be  the judge of quick and dead  
43	to him give all the prophets witness  that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins  
44 	while peter yet spake these words  the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word  
45	and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished  as many as came with peter  because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost  
46	for they heard them speak with tongues  and magnify god  then answered peter  
47	can any man forbid water  that these should not be baptized  which have received the holy ghost as well as we  
48	and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord  then prayed they him to tarry certain days  
acts 11
1 	and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god  
2	and when peter was come up to jerusalem  they that were of the circumcision contended with him  
3	saying  thou wentest in to men uncircumcised  and didst eat with them  
4	but peter rehearsed  the matter  from the beginning  and expounded  it  by order unto them  saying  
5	i was in the city of joppa praying  and in a trance i saw a vision  a certain vessel descend  as it had been a great sheet  let down from heaven by four corners  and it came even to me  
6	upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes  i considered  and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth  and wild beasts  and creeping things  and fowls of the air  
7	and i heard a voice saying unto me  arise  peter  slay and eat  
8	but i said  not so  lord  for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth  
9	but the voice answered me again from heaven  what god hath cleansed   that  call not thou common  
10	and this was done three times  and all were drawn up again into heaven  
11	and  behold  immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was  sent from caesarea unto me  
12	and the spirit bade me go with them  nothing doubting  moreover these six brethren accompanied me  and we entered into the man s house  
13	and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house  which stood and said unto him  send men to joppa  and call for simon  whose surname is peter  
14	who shall tell thee words  whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved  
15	and as i began to speak  the holy ghost fell on them  as on us at the beginning  
16	then remembered i the word of the lord  how that he said  john indeed baptized with water  but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost  
17	forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as  he did  unto us  who believed on the lord jesus christ  what was i  that i could withstand god  
18	when they heard these things  they held their peace  and glorified god  saying  then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life  
19 	now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice  and cyprus  and antioch  preaching the word to none but unto the jews only  
20	and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene  which  when they were come to antioch  spake unto the grecians  preaching the lord jesus  
21	and the hand of the lord was with them  and a great number believed  and turned unto the lord  
22	then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem  and they sent forth barnabas  that he should go as far as antioch  
23	who  when he came  and had seen the grace of god  was glad  and exhorted them all  that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord  
24	for he was a good man  and full of the holy ghost and of faith  and much people was added unto the lord  
25	then departed barnabas to tarsus  for to seek saul  
26	and when he had found him  he brought him unto antioch  and it came to pass  that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church  and taught much people  and the disciples were called christians first in antioch  
27 	and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch  
28	and there stood up one of them named agabus  and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world  which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar  
29	then the disciples  every man according to his ability  determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea  
30	which also they did  and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul  
acts 12
1 	now about that time herod the king stretched forth  his  hands to vex certain of the church  
2	and he killed james the brother of john with the sword  
3	and because he saw it pleased the jews  he proceeded further to take peter also   then were the days of unleavened bread   
4	and when he had apprehended him  he put  him  in prison  and delivered  him  to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him  intending after easter to bring him forth to the people  
5 	peter therefore was kept in prison  but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him  
6	and when herod would have brought him forth  the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers  bound with two chains  and the keepers before the door kept the prison  
7	and  behold  the angel of the lord came upon  him   and a light shined in the prison  and he smote peter on the side  and raised him up  saying  arise up quickly  and his chains fell off from  his  hands  
8	and the angel said unto him  gird thyself  and bind on thy sandals  and so he did  and he saith unto him  cast thy garment about thee  and follow me  
9	and he went out  and followed him  and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel  but thought he saw a vision  
10	when they were past the first and the second ward  they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city  which opened to them of his own accord  and they went out  and passed on through one street  and forthwith the angel departed from him  
11	and when peter was come to himself  he said  now i know of a surety  that the lord hath sent his angel  and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod  and  from  all the expectation of the people of the jews  
12	and when he had considered  the thing   he came to the house of mary the mother of john  whose surname was mark  where many were gathered together praying  
13	and as peter knocked at the door of the gate  a damsel came to hearken  named rhoda  
14	and when she knew peter s voice  she opened not the gate for gladness  but ran in  and told how peter stood before the gate  
15	and they said unto her  thou art mad  but she constantly affirmed that it was even so  then said they  it is his angel  
16	but peter continued knocking  and when they had opened  the door   and saw him  they were astonished  
17	but he  beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace  declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison  and he said  go shew these things unto james  and to the brethren  and he departed  and went into another place  
18	now as soon as it was day  there was no small stir among the soldiers  what was become of peter  
19	and when herod had sought for him  and found him not  he examined the keepers  and commanded that  they  should be put to death  and he went down from judaea to caesarea  and  there  abode  
20 	and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon  but they came with one accord to him  and  having made blastus the king s chamberlain their friend  desired peace  because their country was nourished by the king s  country   
21	and upon a set day herod  arrayed in royal apparel  sat upon his throne  and made an oration unto them  
22	and the people gave a shout   saying  it is  the voice of a god  and not of a man  
23	and immediately the angel of the lord smote him  because he gave not god the glory  and he was eaten of worms  and gave up the ghost  
24	but the word of god grew and multiplied  
25	and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem  when they had fulfilled  their  ministry  and took with them john  whose surname was mark  
acts 13
1 	now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers  as barnabas  and simeon that was called niger  and lucius of cyrene  and manaen  which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch  and saul  
2	as they ministered to the lord  and fasted  the holy ghost said  separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them  
3	and when they had fasted and prayed  and laid  their  hands on them  they sent  them  away  
4 	so they  being sent forth by the holy ghost  departed unto seleucia  and from thence they sailed to cyprus  
5	and when they were at salamis  they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews  and they had also john to  their  minister  
6	and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos  they found a certain sorcerer  a false prophet  a jew  whose name  was  barjesus  
7	which was with the deputy of the country  sergius paulus  a prudent man  who called for barnabas and saul  and desired to hear the word of god  
8	but elymas the sorcerer  for so is his name by interpretation  withstood them  seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith  
9	then saul   who also  is called  paul   filled with the holy ghost  set his eyes on him  
10	and said  o full of all subtilty and all mischief   thou  child of the devil   thou  enemy of all righteousness  wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord  
11	and now  behold  the hand of the lord  is  upon thee  and thou shalt be blind  not seeing the sun for a season  and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness  and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand  
12	then the deputy  when he saw what was done  believed  being astonished at the doctrine of the lord  
13	now when paul and his company loosed from paphos  they came to perga in pamphylia  and john departing from them returned to jerusalem  
14 	but when they departed from perga  they came to antioch in pisidia  and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day  and sat down  
15	and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them  saying   ye  men  and  brethren  if ye have any word of exhortation for the people  say on  
16	then paul stood up  and beckoning with  his  hand said  men of israel  and ye that fear god  give audience  
17	the god of this people of israel chose our fathers  and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt  and with an high arm brought he them out of it  
18	and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness  
19	and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan  he divided their land to them by lot  
20	and after that he gave  unto them  judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years  until samuel the prophet  
21	and afterward they desired a king  and god gave unto them saul the son of cis  a man of the tribe of benjamin  by the space of forty years  
22	and when he had removed him  he raised up unto them david to be their king  to whom also he gave testimony  and said  i have found david the  son  of jesse  a man after mine own heart  which shall fulfil all my will  
23	of this man s seed hath god according to  his  promise raised unto israel a saviour  jesus  
24	when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel  
25	and as john fulfilled his course  he said  whom think ye that i am  i am not  he   but  behold  there cometh one after me  whose shoes of  his  feet i am not worthy to loose  
26	men  and  brethren  children of the stock of abraham  and whosoever among you feareth god  to you is the word of this salvation sent  
27	for they that dwell at jerusalem  and their rulers  because they knew him not  nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day  they have fulfilled  them  in condemning  him   
28	and though they found no cause of death  in him   yet desired they pilate that he should be slain  
29	and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him  they took  him  down from the tree  and laid  him  in a sepulchre  
30	but god raised him from the dead  
31	and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem  who are his witnesses unto the people  
32	and we declare unto you glad tidings  how that the promise which was made unto the fathers  
33	god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children  in that he hath raised up jesus again  as it is also written in the second psalm  thou art my son  this day have i begotten thee  
34	and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead   now  no more to return to corruption  he said on this wise  i will give you the sure mercies of david  
35	wherefore he saith also in another  psalm   thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption  
36	for david  after he had served his own generation by the will of god  fell on sleep  and was laid unto his fathers  and saw corruption  
37	but he  whom god raised again  saw no corruption  
38	be it known unto you therefore  men  and  brethren  that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins  
39	and by him all that believe are justified from all things  from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses  
40	beware therefore  lest that come upon you  which is spoken of in the prophets  
41	behold  ye despisers  and wonder  and perish  for i work a work in your days  a work which ye shall in no wise believe  though a man declare it unto you  
42 	and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue  the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath  
43	now when the congregation was broken up  many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas  who  speaking to them  persuaded them to continue in the grace of god  
44	and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god  
45	but when the jews saw the multitudes  they were filled with envy  and spake against those things which were spoken by paul  contradicting and blaspheming  
46	then paul and barnabas waxed bold  and said  it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you  but seeing ye put it from you  and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life  lo  we turn to the gentiles  
47	for so hath the lord commanded us   saying   i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles  that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth  
48	and when the gentiles heard this  they were glad  and glorified the word of the lord  and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed  
49	and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region  
50	but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women  and the chief men of the city  and raised persecution against paul and barnabas  and expelled them out of their coasts  
51	but they shook off the dust of their feet against them  and came unto iconium  
52	and the disciples were filled with joy  and with the holy ghost  
acts 14
1 	and it came to pass in iconium  that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews  and so spake  that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed  
2	but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles  and made their minds evil affected against the brethren  
3	long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord  which gave testimony unto the word of his grace  and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands  
4	but the multitude of the city was divided  and part held with the jews  and part with the apostles  
5	and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles  and also of the jews with their rulers  to use  them  despitefully  and to stone them  
6	they were ware of  it   and fled unto lystra and derbe  cities of lycaonia  and unto the region that lieth round about  
7	and there they preached the gospel  
8 	and there sat a certain man at lystra  impotent in his feet  being a cripple from his mother s womb  who never had walked  
9	the same heard paul speak  who stedfastly beholding him  and perceiving that he had faith to be healed  
10	said with a loud voice  stand upright on thy feet  and he leaped and walked  
11	and when the people saw what paul had done  they lifted up their voices  saying in the speech of lycaonia  the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men  
12	and they called barnabas  jupiter  and paul  mercurius  because he was the chief speaker  
13	then the priest of jupiter  which was before their city  brought oxen and garlands unto the gates  and would have done sacrifice with the people  
14	 which  when the apostles  barnabas and paul  heard  of   they rent their clothes  and ran in among the people  crying out  
15	and saying  sirs  why do ye these things  we also are men of like passions with you  and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god  which made heaven  and earth  and the sea  and all things that are therein  
16	who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways  
17	nevertheless he left not himself without witness  in that he did good  and gave us rain from heaven  and fruitful seasons  filling our hearts with food and gladness  
18	and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people  that they had not done sacrifice unto them  
19 	and there came thither  certain  jews from antioch and iconium  who persuaded the people  and  having stoned paul  drew  him  out of the city  supposing he had been dead  
20	howbeit  as the disciples stood round about him  he rose up  and came into the city  and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe  
21	and when they had preached the gospel to that city  and had taught many  they returned again to lystra  and  to  iconium  and antioch  
22	confirming the souls of the disciples   and  exhorting them to continue in the faith  and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god  
23	and when they had ordained them elders in every church  and had prayed with fasting  they commended them to the lord  on whom they believed  
24	and after they had passed throughout pisidia  they came to pamphylia  
25	and when they had preached the word in perga  they went down into attalia  
26	and thence sailed to antioch  from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled  
27	and when they were come  and had gathered the church together  they rehearsed all that god had done with them  and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles  
28	and there they abode long time with the disciples  
acts 15
1 	and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren   and said   except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses  ye cannot be saved  
2	when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them  they determined that paul and barnabas  and certain other of them  should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question  
3	and being brought on their way by the church  they passed through phenice and samaria  declaring the conversion of the gentiles  and they caused great joy unto all the brethren  
4	and when they were come to jerusalem  they were received of the church  and  of  the apostles and elders  and they declared all things that god had done with them  
5	but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed  saying  that it was needful to circumcise them  and to command  them  to keep the law of moses  
6 	and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter  
7	and when there had been much disputing  peter rose up  and said unto them  men  and  brethren  ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us  that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel  and believe  
8	and god  which knoweth the hearts  bare them witness  giving them the holy ghost  even as  he did  unto us  
9	and put no difference between us and them  purifying their hearts by faith  
10	now therefore why tempt ye god  to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples  which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear  
11	but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved  even as they  
12	then all the multitude kept silence  and gave audience to barnabas and paul  declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them  
13	and after they had held their peace  james answered  saying  men  and  brethren  hearken unto me  
14	simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles  to take out of them a people for his name  
15	and to this agree the words of the prophets  as it is written  
16	after this i will return  and will build again the tabernacle of david  which is fallen down  and i will build again the ruins thereof  and i will set it up  
17	that the residue of men might seek after the lord  and all the gentiles  upon whom my name is called  saith the lord  who doeth all these things  
18	known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world  
19	wherefore my sentence is  that we trouble not them  which from among the gentiles are turned to god  
20	but that we write unto them  that they abstain from pollutions of idols  and  from  fornication  and  from  things strangled  and  from  blood  
21	for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him  being read in the synagogues every sabbath day  
22 	then pleased it the apostles and elders  with the whole church  to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas   namely   judas surnamed barsabas  and silas  chief men among the brethren  
23	and they wrote  letters  by them after this manner  the apostles and elders and brethren  send  greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia  
24	forasmuch as we have heard  that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words  subverting your souls  saying   ye must  be circumcised  and keep the law  to whom we gave no  such  commandment  
25	it seemed good unto us  being assembled with one accord  to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul  
26	men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ  
27	we have sent therefore judas and silas  who shall also tell  you  the same things by mouth  
28	for it seemed good to the holy ghost  and to us  to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things  
29	that ye abstain from meats offered to idols  and from blood  and from things strangled  and from fornication  from which if ye keep yourselves  ye shall do well  fare ye well  
30	so when they were dismissed  they came to antioch  and when they had gathered the multitude together  they delivered the epistle  
31	 which  when they had read  they rejoiced for the consolation  
32	and judas and silas  being prophets also themselves  exhorted the brethren with many words  and confirmed  them   
33	and after they had tarried  there  a space  they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles  
34	notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still  
35	paul also and barnabas continued in antioch  teaching and preaching the word of the lord  with many others also  
36 	and some days after paul said unto barnabas  let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord   and see  how they do  
37	and barnabas determined to take with them john  whose surname was mark  
38	but paul thought not good to take him with them  who departed from them from pamphylia  and went not with them to the work  
39	and the contention was so sharp between them  that they departed asunder one from the other  and so barnabas took mark  and sailed unto cyprus  
40	and paul chose silas  and departed  being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god  
41	and he went through syria and cilicia  confirming the churches  
acts 16
1 	then came he to derbe and lystra  and  behold  a certain disciple was there  named timotheus  the son of a certain woman  which was a jewess  and believed  but his father  was  a greek  
2	which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium  
3	him would paul have to go forth with him  and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters  for they knew all that his father was a greek  
4	and as they went through the cities  they delivered them the decrees for to keep  that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem  
5	and so were the churches established in the faith  and increased in number daily  
6 	now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia  and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia  
7	after they were come to mysia  they assayed to go into bithynia  but the spirit suffered them not  
8	and they passing by mysia came down to troas  
9	and a vision appeared to paul in the night  there stood a man of macedonia  and prayed him  saying  come over into macedonia  and help us  
10	and after he had seen the vision  immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia  assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them  
11	therefore loosing from troas  we came with a straight course to samothracia  and the next  day  to neapolis  
12	and from thence to philippi  which is the chief city of that part of macedonia   and  a colony  and we were in that city abiding certain days  
13	and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side  where prayer was wont to be made  and we sat down  and spake unto the women which resorted  thither   
14	and a certain woman named lydia  a seller of purple  of the city of thyatira  which worshipped god  heard  us   whose heart the lord opened  that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul  
15	and when she was baptized  and her household  she besought  us   saying  if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord  come into my house  and abide  there   and she constrained us  
16 	and it came to pass  as we went to prayer  a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us  which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying  
17	the same followed paul and us  and cried  saying  these men are the servants of the most high god  which shew unto us the way of salvation  
18	and this did she many days  but paul  being grieved  turned and said to the spirit  i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her  and he came out the same hour  
19	and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone  they caught paul and silas  and drew  them  into the marketplace unto the rulers  
20	and brought them to the magistrates  saying  these men  being jews  do exceedingly trouble our city  
21	and teach customs  which are not lawful for us to receive  neither to observe  being romans  
22	and the multitude rose up together against them  and the magistrates rent off their clothes  and commanded to beat  them   
23	and when they had laid many stripes upon them  they cast  them  into prison  charging the jailor to keep them safely  
24	who  having received such a charge  thrust them into the inner prison  and made their feet fast in the stocks  
25 	and at midnight paul and silas prayed  and sang praises unto god  and the prisoners heard them  
26	and suddenly there was a great earthquake  so that the foundations of the prison were shaken  and immediately all the doors were opened  and every one s bands were loosed  
27	and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep  and seeing the prison doors open  he drew out his sword  and would have killed himself  supposing that the prisoners had been fled  
28	but paul cried with a loud voice  saying  do thyself no harm  for we are all here  
29	then he called for a light  and sprang in  and came trembling  and fell down before paul and silas  
30	and brought them out  and said  sirs  what must i do to be saved  
31	and they said  believe on the lord jesus christ  and thou shalt be saved  and thy house  
32	and they spake unto him the word of the lord  and to all that were in his house  
33	and he took them the same hour of the night  and washed  their  stripes  and was baptized  he and all his  straightway  
34	and when he had brought them into his house  he set meat before them  and rejoiced  believing in god with all his house  
35 	and when it was day  the magistrates sent the serjeants  saying  let those men go  
36	and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul  the magistrates have sent to let you go  now therefore depart  and go in peace  
37	but paul said unto them  they have beaten us openly uncondemned  being romans  and have cast  us  into prison  and now do they thrust us out privily  nay verily  but let them come themselves and fetch us out  
38	and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates  and they feared  when they heard that they were romans  
39	and they came and besought them  and brought  them  out  and desired  them  to depart out of the city  
40	and they went out of the prison  and entered into  the house of  lydia  and when they had seen the brethren  they comforted them  and departed  
acts 17
1 	now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia  they came to thessalonica  where was a synagogue of the jews  
2	and paul  as his manner was  went in unto them  and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures  
3	opening and alleging  that christ must needs have suffered  and risen again from the dead  and that this jesus  whom i preach unto you  is christ  
4	and some of them believed  and consorted with paul and silas  and of the devout greeks a great multitude  and of the chief women not a few  
5	but the jews which believed not  moved with envy  took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort  and gathered a company  and set all the city on an uproar  and assaulted the house of jason  and sought to bring them out to the people  
6	and when they found them not  they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city  crying  these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also  
7	whom jason hath received  and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar  saying that there is another king   one  jesus  
8	and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city  when they heard these things  
9	and when they had taken security of jason  and of the other  they let them go  
10 	and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea  who coming  thither  went into the synagogue of the jews  
11	these were more noble than those in thessalonica  in that they received the word with all readiness of mind  and searched the scriptures daily  whether those things were so  
12	therefore many of them believed  also of honourable women which were greeks  and of men  not a few  
13	but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea  they came thither also  and stirred up the people  
14	and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea  but silas and timotheus abode there still  
15	and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens  and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed  they departed  
16 	now while paul waited for them at athens  his spirit was stirred in him  when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry  
17	therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews  and with the devout persons  and in the market daily with them that met with him  
18	then certain philosophers of the epicureans  and of the stoicks  encountered him  and some said  what will this babbler say  other some  he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods  because he preached unto them jesus  and the resurrection  
19	and they took him  and brought him unto areopagus  saying  may we know what this new doctrine  whereof thou speakest   is   
20	for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears  we would know therefore what these things mean  
21	 for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else  but either to tell  or to hear some new thing   
22 	then paul stood in the midst of mars  hill  and said   ye  men of athens  i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious  
23	for as i passed by  and beheld your devotions  i found an altar with this inscription  to the unknown god  whom therefore ye ignorantly worship  him declare i unto you  
24	god that made the world and all things therein  seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth  dwelleth not in temples made with hands  
25	neither is worshipped with men s hands  as though he needed any thing  seeing he giveth to all life  and breath  and all things  
26	and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth  and hath determined the times before appointed  and the bounds of their habitation  
27	that they should seek the lord  if haply they might feel after him  and find him  though he be not far from every one of us  
28	for in him we live  and move  and have our being  as certain also of your own poets have said  for we are also his offspring  
29	forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god  we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold  or silver  or stone  graven by art and man s device  
30	and the times of this ignorance god winked at  but now commandeth all men every where to repent  
31	because he hath appointed a day  in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by  that  man whom he hath ordained   whereof  he hath given assurance unto all  men   in that he hath raised him from the dead  
32 	and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead  some mocked  and others said  we will hear thee again of this  matter   
33	so paul departed from among them  
34	howbeit certain men clave unto him  and believed  among the which  was  dionysius the areopagite  and a woman named damaris  and others with them  
acts 18
1 	after these things paul departed from athens  and came to corinth  
2	and found a certain jew named aquila  born in pontus  lately come from italy  with his wife priscilla   because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome   and came unto them  
3	and because he was of the same craft  he abode with them  and wrought  for by their occupation they were tentmakers  
4	and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath  and persuaded the jews and the greeks  
5	and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia  paul was pressed in the spirit  and testified to the jews  that  jesus  was  christ  
6	and when they opposed themselves  and blasphemed  he shook  his  raiment  and said unto them  your blood  be  upon your own heads  i  am  clean  from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles  
7 	and he departed thence  and entered into a certain  man s  house  named justus   one  that worshipped god  whose house joined hard to the synagogue  
8	and crispus  the chief ruler of the synagogue  believed on the lord with all his house  and many of the corinthians hearing believed  and were baptized  
9	then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision  be not afraid  but speak  and hold not thy peace  
10	for i am with thee  and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee  for i have much people in this city  
11	and he continued  there  a year and six months  teaching the word of god among them  
12 	and when gallio was the deputy of achaia  the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul  and brought him to the judgment seat  
13	saying  this  fellow  persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law  
14	and when paul was now about to open  his  mouth  gallio said unto the jews  if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness  o  ye  jews  reason would that i should bear with you  
15	but if it be a question of words and names  and  of  your law  look ye  to it   for i will be no judge of such  matters   
16	and he drave them from the judgment seat  
17	then all the greeks took sosthenes  the chief ruler of the synagogue  and beat  him  before the judgment seat  and gallio cared for none of those things  
18 	and paul  after this  tarried  there  yet a good while  and then took his leave of the brethren  and sailed thence into syria  and with him priscilla and aquila  having shorn  his  head in cenchrea  for he had a vow  
19	and he came to ephesus  and left them there  but he himself entered into the synagogue  and reasoned with the jews  
20	when they desired  him  to tarry longer time with them  he consented not  
21	but bade them farewell  saying  i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem  but i will return again unto you  if god will  and he sailed from ephesus  
22	and when he had landed at caesarea  and gone up  and saluted the church  he went down to antioch  
23	and after he had spent some time  there   he departed  and went over  all  the country of galatia and phrygia in order  strengthening all the disciples  
24 	and a certain jew named apollos  born at alexandria  an eloquent man   and  mighty in the scriptures  came to ephesus  
25	this man was instructed in the way of the lord  and being fervent in the spirit  he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord  knowing only the baptism of john  
26	and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue  whom when aquila and priscilla had heard  they took him unto  them   and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly  
27	and when he was disposed to pass into achaia  the brethren wrote  exhorting the disciples to receive him  who  when he was come  helped them much which had believed through grace  
28	for he mightily convinced the jews   and that  publickly  shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ  
acts 19
1 	and it came to pass  that  while apollos was at corinth  paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus  and finding certain disciples  
2	he said unto them  have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed  and they said unto him  we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost  
3	and he said unto them  unto what then were ye baptized  and they said  unto john s baptism  
4	then said paul  john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance  saying unto the people  that they should believe on him which should come after him  that is  on christ jesus  
5	when they heard  this   they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus  
6	and when paul had laid  his  hands upon them  the holy ghost came on them  and they spake with tongues  and prophesied  
7	and all the men were about twelve  
8 	and he went into the synagogue  and spake boldly for the space of three months  disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god  
9	but when divers were hardened  and believed not  but spake evil of that way before the multitude  he departed from them  and separated the disciples  disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus  
10	and this continued by the space of two years  so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus  both jews and greeks  
11	and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul  
12	so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons  and the diseases departed from them  and the evil spirits went out of them  
13 	then certain of the vagabond jews  exorcists  took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus  saying  we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth  
14	and there were seven sons of  one  sceva  a jew   and  chief of the priests  which did so  
15	and the evil spirit answered and said  jesus i know  and paul i know  but who are ye  
16	and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them  and overcame them  and prevailed against them  so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded  
17	and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus  and fear fell on them all  and the name of the lord jesus was magnified  
18	and many that believed came  and confessed  and shewed their deeds  
19	many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together  and burned them before all  men   and they counted the price of them  and found  it  fifty thousand  pieces  of silver  
20	so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed  
21 	after these things were ended  paul purposed in the spirit  when he had passed through macedonia and achaia  to go to jerusalem  saying  after i have been there  i must also see rome  
22	so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him  timotheus and erastus  but he himself stayed in asia for a season  
23	and the same time there arose no small stir about that way  
24	for a certain  man  named demetrius  a silversmith  which made silver shrines for diana  brought no small gain unto the craftsmen  
25	whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation  and said  sirs  ye know that by this craft we have our wealth  
26	moreover ye see and hear  that not alone at ephesus  but almost throughout all asia  this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people  saying that they be no gods  which are made with hands  
27	so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought  but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised  and her magnificence should be destroyed  whom all asia and the world worshippeth  
28	and when they heard  these sayings   they were full of wrath  and cried out  saying  great  is  diana of the ephesians  
29	and the whole city was filled with confusion  and having caught gaius and aristarchus  men of macedonia  paul s companions in travel  they rushed with one accord into the theatre  
30	and when paul would have entered in unto the people  the disciples suffered him not  
31	and certain of the chief of asia  which were his friends  sent unto him  desiring  him  that he would not adventure himself into the theatre  
32	some therefore cried one thing  and some another  for the assembly was confused  and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together  
33	and they drew alexander out of the multitude  the jews putting him forward  and alexander beckoned with the hand  and would have made his defence unto the people  
34	but when they knew that he was a jew  all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out  great  is  diana of the ephesians  
35	and when the townclerk had appeased the people  he said   ye  men of ephesus  what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana  and of the  image  which fell down from jupiter  
36	seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against  ye ought to be quiet  and to do nothing rashly  
37	for ye have brought hither these men  which are neither robbers of churches  nor yet blasphemers of your goddess  
38	wherefore if demetrius  and the craftsmen which are with him  have a matter against any man  the law is open  and there are deputies  let them implead one another  
39	but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters  it shall be determined in a lawful assembly  
40	for we are in danger to be called in question for this day s uproar  there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse  
41	and when he had thus spoken  he dismissed the assembly  
acts 20
1 	and after the uproar was ceased  paul called unto  him  the disciples  and embraced  them   and departed for to go into macedonia  
2	and when he had gone over those parts  and had given them much exhortation  he came into greece  
3	and  there  abode three months  and when the jews laid wait for him  as he was about to sail into syria  he purposed to return through macedonia  
4	and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea  and of the thessalonians  aristarchus and secundus  and gaius of derbe  and timotheus  and of asia  tychicus and trophimus  
5	these going before tarried for us at troas  
6	and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread  and came unto them to troas in five days  where we abode seven days  
7 	and upon the first  day  of the week  when the disciples came together to break bread  paul preached unto them  ready to depart on the morrow  and continued his speech until midnight  
8	and there were many lights in the upper chamber  where they were gathered together  
9	and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus  being fallen into a deep sleep  and as paul was long preaching  he sunk down with sleep  and fell down from the third loft  and was taken up dead  
10	and paul went down  and fell on him  and embracing  him  said  trouble not yourselves  for his life is in him  
11	when he therefore was come up again  and had broken bread  and eaten  and talked a long while  even till break of day  so he departed  
12	and they brought the young man alive  and were not a little comforted  
13 	and we went before to ship  and sailed unto assos  there intending to take in paul  for so had he appointed  minding himself to go afoot  
14	and when he met with us at assos  we took him in  and came to mitylene  
15	and we sailed thence  and came the next  day  over against chios  and the next  day  we arrived at samos  and tarried at trogyllium  and the next  day  we came to miletus  
16	for paul had determined to sail by ephesus  because he would not spend the time in asia  for he hasted  if it were possible for him  to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost  
17 	and from miletus he sent to ephesus  and called the elders of the church  
18	and when they were come to him  he said unto them  ye know  from the first day that i came into asia  after what manner i have been with you at all seasons  
19	serving the lord with all humility of mind  and with many tears  and temptations  which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews  
20	 and  how i kept back nothing that was profitable  unto you   but have shewed you  and have taught you publickly  and from house to house  
21	testifying both to the jews  and also to the greeks  repentance toward god  and faith toward our lord jesus christ  
22	and now  behold  i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem  not knowing the things that shall befall me there  
23	save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city  saying that bonds and afflictions abide me  
24	but none of these things move me  neither count i my life dear unto myself  so that i might finish my course with joy  and the ministry  which i have received of the lord jesus  to testify the gospel of the grace of god  
25	and now  behold  i know that ye all  among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god  shall see my face no more  
26	wherefore i take you to record this day  that i  am  pure from the blood of all  men   
27	for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god  
28	take heed therefore unto yourselves  and to all the flock  over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers  to feed the church of god  which he hath purchased with his own blood  
29	for i know this  that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you  not sparing the flock  
30	also of your own selves shall men arise  speaking perverse things  to draw away disciples after them  
31	therefore watch  and remember  that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears  
32	and now  brethren  i commend you to god  and to the word of his grace  which is able to build you up  and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified  
33	i have coveted no man s silver  or gold  or apparel  
34	yea  ye yourselves know  that these hands have ministered unto my necessities  and to them that were with me  
35	i have shewed you all things  how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak  and to remember the words of the lord jesus  how he said  it is more blessed to give than to receive  
36 	and when he had thus spoken  he kneeled down  and prayed with them all  
37	and they all wept sore  and fell on paul s neck  and kissed him  
38	sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake  that they should see his face no more  and they accompanied him unto the ship  
acts 21
1 	and it came to pass  that after we were gotten from them  and had launched  we came with a straight course unto coos  and the  day  following unto rhodes  and from thence unto patara  
2	and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia  we went aboard  and set forth  
3	now when we had discovered cyprus  we left it on the left hand  and sailed into syria  and landed at tyre  for there the ship was to unlade her burden  
4	and finding disciples  we tarried there seven days  who said to paul through the spirit  that he should not go up to jerusalem  
5	and when we had accomplished those days  we departed and went our way  and they all brought us on our way  with wives and children  till  we were  out of the city  and we kneeled down on the shore  and prayed  
6	and when we had taken our leave one of another  we took ship  and they returned home again  
7	and when we had finished  our  course from tyre  we came to ptolemais  and saluted the brethren  and abode with them one day  
8 	and the next  day  we that were of paul s company departed  and came unto caesarea  and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist  which was  one  of the seven  and abode with him  
9	and the same man had four daughters  virgins  which did prophesy  
10	and as we tarried  there  many days  there came down from judaea a certain prophet  named agabus  
11	and when he was come unto us  he took paul s girdle  and bound his own hands and feet  and said  thus saith the holy ghost  so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle  and shall deliver  him  into the hands of the gentiles  
12	and when we heard these things  both we  and they of that place  besought him not to go up to jerusalem  
13	then paul answered  what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart  for i am ready not to be bound only  but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus  
14	and when he would not be persuaded  we ceased  saying  the will of the lord be done  
15 	and after those days we took up our carriages  and went up to jerusalem  
16	there went with us also  certain  of the disciples of caesarea  and brought with them one mnason of cyprus  an old disciple  with whom we should lodge  
17	and when we were come to jerusalem  the brethren received us gladly  
18	and the  day  following paul went in with us unto james  and all the elders were present  
19	and when he had saluted them  he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry  
20	and when they heard  it   they glorified the lord  and said unto him  thou seest  brother  how many thousands of jews there are which believe  and they are all zealous of the law  
21	and they are informed of thee  that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses  saying that they ought not to circumcise  their  children  neither to walk after the customs  
22	what is it therefore  the multitude must needs come together  for they will hear that thou art come  
23	do therefore this that we say to thee  we have four men which have a vow on them  
24	them take  and purify thyself with them  and be at charges with them  that they may shave  their  heads  and all may know that those things  whereof they were informed concerning thee  are nothing  but  that  thou thyself also walkest orderly  and keepest the law  
25	as touching the gentiles which believe  we have written  and  concluded that they observe no such thing  save only that they keep themselves from  things  offered to idols  and from blood  and from strangled  and from fornication  
26	then paul took the men  and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple  to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification  until that an offering should be offered for every one of them  
27 	and when the seven days were almost ended  the jews which were of asia  when they saw him in the temple  stirred up all the people  and laid hands on him  
28	crying out  men of israel  help  this is the man  that teacheth all  men  every where against the people  and the law  and this place  and further brought greeks also into the temple  and hath polluted this holy place  
29	 for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian  whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple   
30	and all the city was moved  and the people ran together  and they took paul  and drew him out of the temple  and forthwith the doors were shut  
31	and as they went about to kill him  tidings came unto the chief captain of the band  that all jerusalem was in an uproar  
32	who immediately took soldiers and centurions  and ran down unto them  and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers  they left beating of paul  
33	then the chief captain came near  and took him  and commanded  him  to be bound with two chains  and demanded who he was  and what he had done  
34	and some cried one thing  some another  among the multitude  and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult  he commanded him to be carried into the castle  
35	and when he came upon the stairs  so it was  that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people  
36	for the multitude of the people followed after  crying  away with him  
37	and as paul was to be led into the castle  he said unto the chief captain  may i speak unto thee  who said  canst thou speak greek  
38	art not thou that egyptian  which before these days madest an uproar  and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers  
39	but paul said  i am a man  which am  a jew of tarsus   a city  in cilicia  a citizen of no mean city  and  i beseech thee  suffer me to speak unto the people  
40	and when he had given him licence  paul stood on the stairs  and beckoned with the hand unto the people  and when there was made a great silence  he spake unto  them  in the hebrew tongue  saying  
acts 22
1 	men  brethren  and fathers  hear ye my defence  which i make  now unto you  
2	 and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them  they kept the more silence  and he saith   
3 	i am verily a man  which am  a jew  born in tarsus   a city  in cilicia  yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel   and  taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers  and was zealous toward god  as ye all are this day  
4	and i persecuted this way unto the death  binding and delivering into prisons both men and women  
5	as also the high priest doth bear me witness  and all the estate of the elders  from whom also i received letters unto the brethren  and went to damascus  to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem  for to be punished  
6	and it came to pass  that  as i made my journey  and was come nigh unto damascus about noon  suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me  
7	and i fell unto the ground  and heard a voice saying unto me  saul  saul  why persecutest thou me  
8	and i answered  who art thou  lord  and he said unto me  i am jesus of nazareth  whom thou persecutest  
9	and they that were with me saw indeed the light  and were afraid  but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me  
10	and i said  what shall i do  lord  and the lord said unto me  arise  and go into damascus  and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do  
11	and when i could not see for the glory of that light  being led by the hand of them that were with me  i came into damascus  
12	and one ananias  a devout man according to the law  having a good report of all the jews which dwelt  there   
13	came unto me  and stood  and said unto me  brother saul  receive thy sight  and the same hour i looked up upon him  
14	and he said  the god of our fathers hath chosen thee  that thou shouldest know his will  and see that just one  and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth  
15	for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard  
16	and now why tarriest thou  arise  and be baptized  and wash away thy sins  calling on the name of the lord  
17	and it came to pass  that  when i was come again to jerusalem  even while i prayed in the temple  i was in a trance  
18	and saw him saying unto me  make haste  and get thee quickly out of jerusalem  for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me  
19	and i said  lord  they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee  
20	and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed  i also was standing by  and consenting unto his death  and kept the raiment of them that slew him  
21	and he said unto me  depart  for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles  
22 	and they gave him audience unto this word  and  then  lifted up their voices  and said  away with such a  fellow  from the earth  for it is not fit that he should live  
23	and as they cried out  and cast off  their  clothes  and threw dust into the air  
24	the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle  and bade that he should be examined by scourging  that he might know wherefore they cried so against him  
25	and as they bound him with thongs  paul said unto the centurion that stood by  is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman  and uncondemned  
26	when the centurion heard  that   he went and told the chief captain  saying  take heed what thou doest  for this man is a roman  
27	then the chief captain came  and said unto him  tell me  art thou a roman  he said  yea  
28	and the chief captain answered  with a great sum obtained i this freedom  and paul said  but i was  free  born  
29	then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him  and the chief captain also was afraid  after he knew that he was a roman  and because he had bound him  
30	on the morrow  because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews  he loosed him from  his  bands  and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear  and brought paul down  and set him before them  
acts 23
1 	and paul  earnestly beholding the council  said  men  and  brethren  i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day  
2	and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth  
3	then said paul unto him  god shall smite thee   thou  whited wall  for sittest thou to judge me after the law  and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law  
4	and they that stood by said  revilest thou god s high priest  
5	then said paul  i wist not  brethren  that he was the high priest  for it is written  thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people  
6 	but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees  and the other pharisees  he cried out in the council  men  and  brethren  i am a pharisee  the son of a pharisee  of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question  
7	and when he had so said  there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees  and the multitude was divided  
8	for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection  neither angel  nor spirit  but the pharisees confess both  
9	and there arose a great cry  and the scribes  that were  of the pharisees  part arose  and strove  saying  we find no evil in this man  but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him  let us not fight against god  
10	and when there arose a great dissension  the chief captain  fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them  commanded the soldiers to go down  and to take him by force from among them  and to bring  him  into the castle  
11	and the night following the lord stood by him  and said  be of good cheer  paul  for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem  so must thou bear witness also at rome  
12 	and when it was day  certain of the jews banded together  and bound themselves under a curse  saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul  
13	and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy  
14	and they came to the chief priests and elders  and said  we have bound ourselves under a great curse  that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul  
15	now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow  as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him  and we  or ever he come near  are ready to kill him  
16	and when paul s sister s son heard of their lying in wait  he went and entered into the castle  and told paul  
17	then paul called one of the centurions unto  him   and said  bring this young man unto the chief captain  for he hath a certain thing to tell him  
18	so he took him  and brought  him  to the chief captain  and said  paul the prisoner called me unto  him   and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee  who hath something to say unto thee  
19	then the chief captain took him by the hand  and went  with him  aside privately  and asked  him   what is that thou hast to tell me  
20	and he said  the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council  as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly  
21	but do not thou yield unto them  for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men  which have bound themselves with an oath  that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him  and now are they ready  looking for a promise from thee  
22	so the chief captain  then  let the young man depart  and charged  him  see thou  tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me  
23	and he called unto  him  two centurions  saying  make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea  and horsemen threescore and ten  and spearmen two hundred  at the third hour of the night  
24	and provide  them  beasts  that they may set paul on  and bring  him  safe unto felix the governor  
25	and he wrote a letter after this manner  
26	claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix  sendeth  greeting  
27	this man was taken of the jews  and should have been killed of them  then came i with an army  and rescued him  having understood that he was a roman  
28	and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him  i brought him forth into their council  
29	whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law  but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds  
30	and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man  i sent straightway to thee  and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what  they had  against him  farewell  
31	then the soldiers  as it was commanded them  took paul  and brought  him  by night to antipatris  
32	on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him  and returned to the castle  
33	who  when they came to caesarea  and delivered the epistle to the governor  presented paul also before him  
34	and when the governor had read  the letter   he asked of what province he was  and when he understood that  he was  of cilicia  
35	i will hear thee  said he  when thine accusers are also come  and he commanded him to be kept in herod s judgment hall  
acts 24
1 	and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders  and  with  a certain orator  named  tertullus  who informed the governor against paul  
2	and when he was called forth  tertullus began to accuse  him   saying  seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness  and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence  
3	we accept  it  always  and in all places  most noble felix  with all thankfulness  
4	notwithstanding  that i be not further tedious unto thee  i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words  
5	for we have found this man  a  pestilent  fellow   and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world  and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes  
6	who also hath gone about to profane the temple  whom we took  and would have judged according to our law  
7	but the chief captain lysias came  upon us   and with great violence took  him  away out of our hands  
8	commanding his accusers to come unto thee  by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things  whereof we accuse him  
9	and the jews also assented  saying that these things were so  
10 	then paul  after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak  answered  forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation  i do the more cheerfully answer for myself  
11	because that thou mayest understand  that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship  
12	and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man  neither raising up the people  neither in the synagogues  nor in the city  
13	neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me  
14	but this i confess unto thee  that after the way which they call heresy  so worship i the god of my fathers  believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets  
15	and have hope toward god  which they themselves also allow  that there shall be a resurrection of the dead  both of the just and unjust  
16	and herein do i exercise myself  to have always a conscience void of offence toward god  and  toward  men  
17	now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation  and offerings  
18	whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple  neither with multitude  nor with tumult  
19	who ought to have been here before thee  and object  if they had ought against me  
20	or else let these same  here  say  if they have found any evil doing in me  while i stood before the council  
21	except it be for this one voice  that i cried standing among them  touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day  
22 	and when felix heard these things  having more perfect knowledge of  that  way  he deferred them  and said  when lysias the chief captain shall come down  i will know the uttermost of your matter  
23	and he commanded a centurion to keep paul  and to let  him  have liberty  and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him  
24	and after certain days  when felix came with his wife drusilla  which was a jewess  he sent for paul  and heard him concerning the faith in christ  
25	and as he reasoned of righteousness  temperance  and judgment to come  felix trembled  and answered  go thy way for this time  when i have a convenient season  i will call for thee  
26	he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul  that he might loose him  wherefore he sent for him the oftener  and communed with him  
27	but after two years porcius festus came into felix  room  and felix  willing to shew the jews a pleasure  left paul bound  
acts 25
1 	now when festus was come into the province  after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem  
2	then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul  and besought him  
3	and desired favour against him  that he would send for him to jerusalem  laying wait in the way to kill him  
4	but festus answered  that paul should be kept at caesarea  and that he himself would depart shortly  thither   
5	let them therefore  said he  which among you are able  go down with  me   and accuse this man  if there be any wickedness in him  
6	and when he had tarried among them more than ten days  he went down unto caesarea  and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought  
7	and when he was come  the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about  and laid many and grievous complaints against paul  which they could not prove  
8	while he answered for himself  neither against the law of the jews  neither against the temple  nor yet against caesar  have i offended any thing at all  
9	but festus  willing to do the jews a pleasure  answered paul  and said  wilt thou go up to jerusalem  and there be judged of these things before me  
10	then said paul  i stand at caesar s judgment seat  where i ought to be judged  to the jews have i done no wrong  as thou very well knowest  
11	for if i be an offender  or have committed any thing worthy of death  i refuse not to die  but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me  no man may deliver me unto them  i appeal unto caesar  
12	then festus  when he had conferred with the council  answered  hast thou appealed unto caesar  unto caesar shalt thou go  
13 	and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus  
14	and when they had been there many days  festus declared paul s cause unto the king  saying  there is a certain man left in bonds by felix  
15	about whom  when i was at jerusalem  the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed  me   desiring  to have  judgment against him  
16	to whom i answered  it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die  before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face  and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him  
17	therefore  when they were come hither  without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat  and commanded the man to be brought forth  
18	against whom when the accusers stood up  they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed  
19	but had certain questions against him of their own superstition  and of one jesus  which was dead  whom paul affirmed to be alive  
20	and because i doubted of such manner of questions  i asked  him  whether he would go to jerusalem  and there be judged of these matters  
21	but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus  i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar  
22	then agrippa said unto festus  i would also hear the man myself  to morrow  said he  thou shalt hear him  
23	and on the morrow  when agrippa was come  and bernice  with great pomp  and was entered into the place of hearing  with the chief captains  and principal men of the city  at festus  commandment paul was brought forth  
24	and festus said  king agrippa  and all men which are here present with us  ye see this man  about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me  both at jerusalem  and  also  here  crying that he ought not to live any longer  
25	but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death  and that he himself hath appealed to augustus  i have determined to send him  
26	of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord  wherefore i have brought him forth before you  and specially before thee  o king agrippa  that  after examination had  i might have somewhat to write  
27	for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner  and not withal to signify the crimes  laid  against him  
acts 26
1 	then agrippa said unto paul  thou art permitted to speak for thyself  then paul stretched forth the hand  and answered for himself  
2	i think myself happy  king agrippa  because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews  
3	especially  because i know  thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews  wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently  
4	my manner of life from my youth  which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem  know all the jews  
5	which knew me from the beginning  if they would testify  that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee  
6	and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers  
7	unto which  promise  our twelve tribes  instantly serving  god  day and night  hope to come  for which hope s sake  king agrippa  i am accused of the jews  
8	why should it be thought a thing incredible with you  that god should raise the dead  
9	i verily thought with myself  that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth  
10	which thing i also did in jerusalem  and many of the saints did i shut up in prison  having received authority from the chief priests  and when they were put to death  i gave my voice against  them   
11	and i punished them oft in every synagogue  and compelled  them  to blaspheme  and being exceedingly mad against them  i persecuted  them  even unto strange cities  
12 	whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests  
13	at midday  o king  i saw in the way a light from heaven  above the brightness of the sun  shining round about me and them which journeyed with me  
14	and when we were all fallen to the earth  i heard a voice speaking unto me  and saying in the hebrew tongue  saul  saul  why persecutest thou me   it is  hard for thee to kick against the pricks  
15	and i said  who art thou  lord  and he said  i am jesus whom thou persecutest  
16	but rise  and stand upon thy feet  for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose  to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen  and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee  
17	delivering thee from the people  and  from  the gentiles  unto whom now i send thee  
18	to open their eyes   and  to turn  them  from darkness to light  and  from  the power of satan unto god  that they may receive forgiveness of sins  and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me  
19	whereupon  o king agrippa  i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision  
20	but shewed first unto them of damascus  and at jerusalem  and throughout all the coasts of judaea  and  then  to the gentiles  that they should repent and turn to god  and do works meet for repentance  
21	for these causes the jews caught me in the temple  and went about to kill  me   
22	having therefore obtained help of god  i continue unto this day  witnessing both to small and great  saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come  
23	that christ should suffer   and  that he should be the first that should rise from the dead  and should shew light unto the people  and to the gentiles  
24 	and as he thus spake for himself  festus said with a loud voice  paul  thou art beside thyself  much learning doth make thee mad  
25	but he said  i am not mad  most noble festus  but speak forth the words of truth and soberness  
26	for the king knoweth of these things  before whom also i speak freely  for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him  for this thing was not done in a corner  
27	king agrippa  believest thou the prophets  i know that thou believest  
28	then agrippa said unto paul  almost thou persuadest me to be a christian  
29	and paul said  i would to god  that not only thou  but also all that hear me this day  were both almost  and altogether such as i am  except these bonds  
30	and when he had thus spoken  the king rose up  and the governor  and bernice  and they that sat with them  
31	and when they were gone aside  they talked between themselves  saying  this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds  
32	then said agrippa unto festus  this man might have been set at liberty  if he had not appealed unto caesar  
acts 27
1 	and when it was determined that we should sail into italy  they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto  one  named julius  a centurion of augustus  band  
2	and entering into a ship of adramyttium  we launched  meaning to sail by the coasts of asia   one  aristarchus  a macedonian of thessalonica  being with us  
3	and the next  day  we touched at sidon  and julius courteously entreated paul  and gave  him  liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself  
4	and when we had launched from thence  we sailed under cyprus  because the winds were contrary  
5	and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia  we came to myra   a city  of lycia  
6	and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy  and he put us therein  
7	and when we had sailed slowly many days  and scarce were come over against cnidus  the wind not suffering us  we sailed under crete  over against salmone  
8	and  hardly passing it  came unto a place which is called the fair havens  nigh whereunto was the city  of  lasea  
9	now when much time was spent  and when sailing was now dangerous  because the fast was now already past  paul admonished  them   
10	and said unto them  sirs  i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage  not only of the lading and ship  but also of our lives  
11	nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship  more than those things which were spoken by paul  
12 	and because the haven was not commodious to winter in  the more part advised to depart thence also  if by any means they might attain to phenice   and there  to winter   which is  an haven of crete  and lieth toward the south west and north west  
13	and when the south wind blew softly  supposing that they had obtained  their  purpose  loosing  thence   they sailed close by crete  
14	but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind  called euroclydon  
15	and when the ship was caught  and could not bear up into the wind  we let  her  drive  
16	and running under a certain island which is called clauda  we had much work to come by the boat  
17	which when they had taken up  they used helps  undergirding the ship  and  fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands  strake sail  and so were driven  
18	and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest  the next  day  they lightened the ship  
19	and the third  day  we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship  
20	and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared  and no small tempest lay on  us   all hope that we should be saved was then taken away  
21 	but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them  and said  sirs  ye should have hearkened unto me  and not have loosed from crete  and to have gained this harm and loss  
22	and now i exhort you to be of good cheer  for there shall be no loss of  any man s  life among you  but of the ship  
23	for there stood by me this night the angel of god  whose i am  and whom i serve  
24	saying  fear not  paul  thou must be brought before caesar  and  lo  god hath given thee all them that sail with thee  
25	wherefore  sirs  be of good cheer  for i believe god  that it shall be even as it was told me  
26	howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island  
27	but when the fourteenth night was come  as we were driven up and down in adria  about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country  
28	and sounded  and found  it  twenty fathoms  and when they had gone a little further  they sounded again  and found  it  fifteen fathoms  
29	then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks  they cast four anchors out of the stern  and wished for the day  
30	and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship  when they had let down the boat into the sea  under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship  
31	paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers  except these abide in the ship  ye cannot be saved  
32	then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat  and let her fall off  
33	and while the day was coming on  paul besought  them  all to take meat  saying  this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting  having taken nothing  
34	wherefore i pray you to take  some  meat  for this is for your health  for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you  
35	and when he had thus spoken  he took bread  and gave thanks to god in presence of them all  and when he had broken  it   he began to eat  
36	then were they all of good cheer  and they also took  some  meat  
37	and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls  
38	and when they had eaten enough  they lightened the ship  and cast out the wheat into the sea  
39	and when it was day  they knew not the land  but they discovered a certain creek with a shore  into the which they were minded  if it were possible  to thrust in the ship  
40	and when they had taken up the anchors  they committed  themselves  unto the sea  and loosed the rudder bands  and hoised up the mainsail to the wind  and made toward shore  
41	and falling into a place where two seas met  they ran the ship aground  and the forepart stuck fast  and remained unmoveable  but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves  
42	and the soldiers  counsel was to kill the prisoners  lest any of them should swim out  and escape  
43	but the centurion  willing to save paul  kept them from  their  purpose  and commanded that they which could swim should cast  themselves  first  into the sea   and get to land  
44	and the rest  some on boards  and some on  broken pieces  of the ship  and so it came to pass  that they escaped all safe to land  
acts 28
1 	and when they were escaped  then they knew that the island was called melita  
2	and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness  for they kindled a fire  and received us every one  because of the present rain  and because of the cold  
3	and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks  and laid  them  on the fire  there came a viper out of the heat  and fastened on his hand  
4	and when the barbarians saw the  venomous  beast hang on his hand  they said among themselves  no doubt this man is a murderer  whom  though he hath escaped the sea  yet vengeance suffereth not to live  
5	and he shook off the beast into the fire  and felt no harm  
6	howbeit they looked when he should have swollen  or fallen down dead suddenly  but after they had looked a great while  and saw no harm come to him  they changed their minds  and said that he was a god  
7	in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island  whose name was publius  who received us  and lodged us three days courteously  
8	and it came to pass  that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux  to whom paul entered in  and prayed  and laid his hands on him  and healed him  
9	so when this was done  others also  which had diseases in the island  came  and were healed  
10	who also honoured us with many honours  and when we departed  they laded  us  with such things as were necessary  
11 	and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria  which had wintered in the isle  whose sign was castor and pollux  
12	and landing at syracuse  we tarried  there  three days  
13	and from thence we fetched a compass  and came to rhegium  and after one day the south wind blew  and we came the next day to puteoli  
14	where we found brethren  and were desired to tarry with them seven days  and so we went toward rome  
15	and from thence  when the brethren heard of us  they came to meet us as far as appii forum  and the three taverns  whom when paul saw  he thanked god  and took courage  
16	and when we came to rome  the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard  but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him  
17 	and it came to pass  that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together  and when they were come together  he said unto them  men  and  brethren  though i have committed nothing against the people  or customs of our fathers  yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans  
18	who  when they had examined me  would have let  me  go  because there was no cause of death in me  
19	but when the jews spake against  it   i was constrained to appeal unto caesar  not that i had ought to accuse my nation of  
20	for this cause therefore have i called for you  to see  you   and to speak with  you   because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain  
21	and they said unto him  we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee  neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee  
22	but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest  for as concerning this sect  we know that every where it is spoken against  
23 	and when they had appointed him a day  there came many to him into  his  lodging  to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god  persuading them concerning jesus  both out of the law of moses  and  out of  the prophets  from morning till evening  
24	and some believed the things which were spoken  and some believed not  
25	and when they agreed not among themselves  they departed  after that paul had spoken one word  well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers  
26	saying  go unto this people  and say  hearing ye shall hear  and shall not understand  and seeing ye shall see  and not perceive  
27	for the heart of this people is waxed gross  and their ears are dull of hearing  and their eyes have they closed  lest they should see with  their  eyes  and hear with  their  ears  and understand with  their  heart  and should be converted  and i should heal them  
28	be it known therefore unto you  that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles  and  that  they will hear it  
29	and when he had said these words  the jews departed  and had great reasoning among themselves  
30 	and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house  and received all that came in unto him  
31	preaching the kingdom of god  and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ  with all confidence  no man forbidding him

2	 which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures   
3	concerning his son jesus christ our lord  which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh  
4	and declared  to be  the son of god with power  according to the spirit of holiness  by the resurrection from the dead

6	among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ  
7	to all that be in rome  beloved of god  called  to be  saints  grace to you and peace from god our father  and the lord jesus christ  
8 	first  i thank my god through jesus christ for you all  that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world  
9	for god is my witness  whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son  that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers  
10	making request  if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you  
11	for i long to see you  that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift  to the end ye may be established  
12	that is  that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me  
13	now i would not have you ignorant  brethren  that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you   but was let hitherto   that i might have some fruit among you also  even as among other gentiles  
14	i am debtor both to the greeks  and to the barbarians  both to the wise  and to the unwise  
15	so  as much as in me is  i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also  
16 	for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ  for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth  to the jew first  and also to the greek  
17	for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith  as it is written  the just shall live by faith  
18	for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men  who hold the truth in unrighteousness  
19 	because that which may be known of god is manifest in them  for god hath shewed  it  unto them  
20	for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen  being understood by the things that are made   even  his eternal power and godhead  so that they are without excuse  
21	because that  when they knew god  they glorified  him  not as god  neither were thankful  but became vain in their imaginations  and their foolish heart was darkened  
22	professing themselves to be wise  they became fools  
23	and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man  and to birds  and fourfooted beasts  and creeping things  
24	wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts  to dishonour their own bodies between themselves  
25	who changed the truth of god into a lie  and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator  who is blessed for ever  amen  
26	for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature  
27	and likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust one toward another  men with men working that which is unseemly  and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet  
28	and even as they did not like to retain god in  their  knowledge  god gave them over to a reprobate mind  to do those things which are not convenient  
29	being filled with all unrighteousness  fornication  wickedness  covetousness  maliciousness  full of envy  murder  debate  deceit  malignity  whisperers  
30	backbiters  haters of god  despiteful  proud  boasters  inventors of evil things  disobedient to parents  
31	without understanding  covenantbreakers  without natural affection  implacable  unmerciful  
32	who knowing the judgment of god  that they which commit such things are worthy of death  not only do the same  but have pleasure in them that do them  
romans 2
1 	therefore thou art inexcusable  o man  whosoever thou art that judgest  for wherein thou judgest another  thou condemnest thyself  for thou that judgest doest the same things  
2	but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things  
3	and thinkest thou this  o man  that judgest them which do such things  and doest the same  that thou shalt escape the judgment of god  
4	or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering  not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance  
5	but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god  
6	who will render to every man according to his deeds  
7	to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality  eternal life  
8	but unto them that are contentious  and do not obey the truth  but obey unrighteousness  indignation and wrath  
9	tribulation and anguish  upon every soul of man that doeth evil  of the jew first  and also of the gentile  
10	but glory  honour  and peace  to every man that worketh good  to the jew first  and also to the gentile  
11	for there is no respect of persons with god  
12	for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law  and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law  
13	 for not the hearers of the law  are  just before god  but the doers of the law shall be justified  
14	for when the gentiles  which have not the law  do by nature the things contained in the law  these  having not the law  are a law unto themselves  
15	which shew the work of the law written in their hearts  their conscience also bearing witness  and  their  thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another   
16	in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel  
17 	behold  thou art called a jew  and restest in the law  and makest thy boast of god  
18	and knowest  his  will  and approvest the things that are more excellent  being instructed out of the law  
19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind  a light of them which are in darkness  
20	an instructor of the foolish  a teacher of babes  which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law  
21	thou therefore which teachest another  teachest thou not thyself  thou that preachest a man should not steal  dost thou steal  
22	thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery  dost thou commit adultery  thou that abhorrest idols  dost thou commit sacrilege  
23	thou that makest thy boast of the law  through breaking the law dishonourest thou god  
24	for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you  as it is written  
25	for circumcision verily profiteth  if thou keep the law  but if thou be a breaker of the law  thy circumcision is made uncircumcision  
26	therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law  shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision  
27	and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature  if it fulfil the law  judge thee  who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law  
28	for he is not a jew  which is one outwardly  neither  is that  circumcision  which is outward in the flesh  
29	but he  is  a jew  which is one inwardly  and circumcision  is that  of the heart  in the spirit   and  not in the letter  whose praise  is  not of men  but of god  
romans 3
1 	what advantage then hath the jew  or what profit  is there  of circumcision

3	for what if some did not believe  shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect  
4	god forbid  yea  let god be true  but every man a liar  as it is written  that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings  and mightest overcome when thou art judged  
5	but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god  what shall we say   is  god unrighteous who taketh vengeance   i speak as a man  
6	god forbid  for then how shall god judge the world  
7	for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory  why yet am i also judged as a sinner  
8	and not  rather    as we be slanderously reported  and as some affirm that we say   let us do evil  that good may come  whose damnation is just  
9	what then  are we better  than they   no  in no wise  for we have before proved both jews and gentiles  that they are all under sin  
10	as it is written  there is none righteous  no  not one  
11	there is none that understandeth  there is none that seeketh after god  
12	they are all gone out of the way  they are together become unprofitable  there is none that doeth good  no  not one  
13	their throat  is  an open sepulchre  with their tongues they have used deceit  the poison of asps  is  under their lips  
14	whose mouth  is  full of cursing and bitterness  
15	their feet  are  swift to shed blood  
16	destruction and misery  are  in their ways  
17	and the way of peace have they not known  
18	there is no fear of god before their eyes  
19 	now we know that what things soever the law saith  it saith to them who are under the law  that every mouth may be stopped  and all the world may become guilty before god  
20	therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight  for by the law  is  the knowledge of sin  
21	but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested  being witnessed by the law and the prophets  
22	even the righteousness of god  which is  by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe  for there is no difference  
23	for all have sinned  and come short of the glory of god  
24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus  
25	whom god hath set forth  to be  a propitiation through faith in his blood  to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past  through the forbearance of god  
26	to declare   i say   at this time his righteousness  that he might be just  and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus  
27	where  is  boasting then  it is excluded  by what law  of works  nay  but by the law of faith  
28	therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law  
29	 is he  the god of the jews only   is he  not also of the gentiles  yes  of the gentiles also  
30	seeing  it is  one god  which shall justify the circumcision by faith  and uncircumcision through faith  
31	do we then make void the law through faith  god forbid  yea  we establish the law  
romans 4
1 	what shall we say then that abraham our father  as pertaining to the flesh  hath found  
2	for if abraham were justified by works  he hath  whereof  to glory  but not before god  
3	for what saith the scripture  abraham believed god  and it was counted unto him for righteousness  
4	now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace  but of debt  
5	but to him that worketh not  but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly  his faith is counted for righteousness  
6	even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man  unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works  
7	 saying   blessed  are  they whose iniquities are forgiven  and whose sins are covered  
8	blessed  is  the man to whom the lord will not impute sin  
9 	 cometh  this blessedness then upon the circumcision  only   or upon the uncircumcision also  for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness  
10	how was it then reckoned  when he was in circumcision  or in uncircumcision  not in circumcision  but in uncircumcision  
11	and he received the sign of circumcision  a seal of the righteousness of the faith which  he had yet  being uncircumcised  that he might be the father of all them that believe  though they be not circumcised  that righteousness might be imputed unto them also  
12	and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only  but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham  which  he had  being  yet  uncircumcised  
13	for the promise  that he should be the heir of the world   was  not to abraham  or to his seed  through the law  but through the righteousness of faith  
14	for if they which are of the law  be  heirs  faith is made void  and the promise made of none effect  
15	because the law worketh wrath  for where no law is   there is  no transgression  
16	therefore  it is  of faith  that  it might be  by grace  to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed  not to that only which is of the law  but to that also which is of the faith of abraham  who is the father of us all  
17 	 as it is written  i have made thee a father of many nations   before him whom he believed   even  god  who quickeneth the dead  and calleth those things which be not as though they were  
18	who against hope believed in hope  that he might become the father of many nations  according to that which was spoken  so shall thy seed be  
19	and being not weak in faith  he considered not his own body now dead  when he was about an hundred years old  neither yet the deadness of sara s womb  
20	he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief  but was strong in faith  giving glory to god  
21	and being fully persuaded that  what he had promised  he was able also to perform  
22	and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness  
23 	now it was not written for his sake alone  that it was imputed to him  
24	but for us also  to whom it shall be imputed  if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead  
25	who was delivered for our offences  and was raised again for our justification  
romans 5
1 	therefore being justified by faith  we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ  
2	by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand  and rejoice in hope of the glory of god  
3	and not only  so   but we glory in tribulations also  knowing that tribulation worketh patience  
4	and patience  experience  and experience  hope  
5	and hope maketh not ashamed  because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us  
6 	for when we were yet without strength  in due time christ died for the ungodly  
7	for scarcely for a righteous man will one die  yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die  
8	but god commendeth his love toward us  in that  while we were yet sinners  christ died for us  
9	much more then  being now justified by his blood  we shall be saved from wrath through him  
10	for if  when we were enemies  we were reconciled to god by the death of his son  much more  being reconciled  we shall be saved by his life  
11	and not only  so   but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ  by whom we have now received the atonement  
12	wherefore  as by one man sin entered into the world  and death by sin  and so death passed upon all men  for that all have sinned  
13	 for until the law sin was in the world  but sin is not imputed when there is no law  
14	nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses  even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam s transgression  who is the figure of him that was to come  
15	but not as the offence  so also  is  the free gift  for if through the offence of one many be dead  much more the grace of god  and the gift by grace   which is  by one man  jesus christ  hath abounded unto many  
16	and not as  it was  by one that sinned   so is  the gift  for the judgment  was  by one to condemnation  but the free gift  is  of many offences unto justification  
17	for if by one man s offence death reigned by one  much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one  jesus christ   
18	therefore as by the offence of one  judgment came  upon all men to condemnation  even so by the righteousness of one  the free gift came  upon all men unto justification of life  
19	for as by one man s disobedience many were made sinners  so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous  
20	moreover the law entered  that the offence might abound  but where sin abounded  grace did much more abound  
21	that as sin hath reigned unto death  even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord  
romans 6
1 	what shall we say then  shall we continue in sin  that grace may abound  
2	god forbid  how shall we  that are dead to sin  live any longer therein  
3	know ye not  that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death  
4	therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death  that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father  even so we also should walk in newness of life  
5	for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death  we shall be also  in the likeness  of  his  resurrection  
6	knowing this  that our old man is crucified with  him   that the body of sin might be destroyed  that henceforth we should not serve sin  
7	for he that is dead is freed from sin  
8	now if we be dead with christ  we believe that we shall also live with him  
9	knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more  death hath no more dominion over him  
10	for in that he died  he died unto sin once  but in that he liveth  he liveth unto god  
11	likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin  but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord  
12	let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body  that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof  
13	neither yield ye your members  as  instruments of unrighteousness unto sin  but yield yourselves unto god  as those that are alive from the dead  and your members  as  instruments of righteousness unto god  
14	for sin shall not have dominion over you  for ye are not under the law  but under grace  
15	what then  shall we sin  because we are not under the law  but under grace  god forbid  
16	know ye not  that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey  his servants ye are to whom ye obey  whether of sin unto death  or of obedience unto righteousness  
17	but god be thanked  that ye were the servants of sin  but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you  
18	being then made free from sin  ye became the servants of righteousness  
19	i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh  for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity  even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness  
20	for when ye were the servants of sin  ye were free from righteousness  
21	what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed  for the end of those things  is  death  
22	but now being made free from sin  and become servants to god  ye have your fruit unto holiness  and the end everlasting life  
23	for the wages of sin  is  death  but the gift of god  is  eternal life through jesus christ our lord  
romans 7
1 	know ye not  brethren   for i speak to them that know the law   how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth  
2	for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to  her  husband so long as he liveth  but if the husband be dead  she is loosed from the law of  her  husband  
3	so then if  while  her  husband liveth  she be married to another man  she shall be called an adulteress  but if her husband be dead  she is free from that law  so that she is no adulteress  though she be married to another man  
4	wherefore  my brethren  ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ  that ye should be married to another   even  to him who is raised from the dead  that we should bring forth fruit unto god  
5	for when we were in the flesh  the motions of sins  which were by the law  did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death  
6	but now we are delivered from the law  that being dead wherein we were held  that we should serve in newness of spirit  and not  in  the oldness of the letter  
7 	what shall we say then   is  the law sin  god forbid  nay  i had not known sin  but by the law  for i had not known lust  except the law had said  thou shalt not covet  
8	but sin  taking occasion by the commandment  wrought in me all manner of concupiscence  for without the law sin  was  dead  
9	for i was alive without the law once  but when the commandment came  sin revived  and i died  
10	and the commandment  which  was ordained  to life  i found  to be  unto death  
11	for sin  taking occasion by the commandment  deceived me  and by it slew  me   
12	wherefore the law  is  holy  and the commandment holy  and just  and good  
13	was then that which is good made death unto me  god forbid  but sin  that it might appear sin  working death in me by that which is good  that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful  
14 	for we know that the law is spiritual  but i am carnal  sold under sin  
15	for that which i do i allow not  for what i would  that do i not  but what i hate  that do i  
16	if then i do that which i would not  i consent unto the law that  it is  good  
17	now then it is no more i that do it  but sin that dwelleth in me  
18	for i know that in me  that is  in my flesh   dwelleth no good thing  for to will is present with me  but  how  to perform that which is good i find not  
19	for the good that i would i do not  but the evil which i would not  that i do  
20	now if i do that i would not  it is no more i that do it  but sin that dwelleth in me  
21	i find then a law  that  when i would do good  evil is present with me  
22	for i delight in the law of god after the inward man  
23	but i see another law in my members  warring against the law of my mind  and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members  
24	o wretched man that i am  who shall deliver me from the body of this death  
25	i thank god through jesus christ our lord  so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god  but with the flesh the law of sin  
romans 8
1 	 there is  therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus  who walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit  
2	for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death  
3	for what the law could not do  in that it was weak through the flesh  god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh  and for sin  condemned sin in the flesh  
4	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us  who walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit  
5	for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh  but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit  
6	for to be carnally minded  is  death  but to be spiritually minded  is  life and peace  
7	because the carnal mind  is  enmity against god  for it is not subject to the law of god  neither indeed can be  
8	so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god  
9	but ye are not in the flesh  but in the spirit  if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you  now if any man have not the spirit of christ  he is none of his  
10 	and if christ  be  in you  the body  is  dead because of sin  but the spirit  is  life because of righteousness  
11	but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you  he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you  
12	therefore  brethren  we are debtors  not to the flesh  to live after the flesh  
13	for if ye live after the flesh  ye shall die  but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body  ye shall live  
14	for as many as are led by the spirit of god  they are the sons of god  
15	for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear  but ye have received the spirit of adoption  whereby we cry  abba  father  
16	the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit  that we are the children of god  
17 	and if children  then heirs  heirs of god  and joint heirs with christ  if so be that we suffer with  him   that we may be also glorified together  
18	for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time  are  not worthy  to be compared  with the glory which shall be revealed in us  
19	for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god  
20	for the creature was made subject to vanity  not willingly  but by reason of him who hath subjected  the same  in hope  
21	because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god  
22	for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now  
23	and not only  they   but ourselves also  which have the firstfruits of the spirit  even we ourselves groan within ourselves  waiting for the adoption   to wit   the redemption of our body  
24	for we are saved by hope  but hope that is seen is not hope  for what a man seeth  why doth he yet hope for  
25	but if we hope for that we see not   then  do we with patience wait for  it   
26 	likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities  for we know not what we should pray for as we ought  but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered  
27	and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what  is  the mind of the spirit  because he maketh intercession for the saints according to  the will of  god  
28	and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god  to them who are the called according to  his  purpose  
29 	for whom he did foreknow  he also did predestinate  to be  conformed to the image of his son  that he might be the firstborn among many brethren  
30	moreover whom he did predestinate  them he also called  and whom he called  them he also justified  and whom he justified  them he also glorified  
31 	what shall we then say to these things  if god  be  for us  who  can be  against us  
32	he that spared not his own son  but delivered him up for us all  how shall he not with him also freely give us all things  
33	who shall lay any thing to the charge of god s elect   it is  god that justifieth  
34	who  is  he that condemneth   it is  christ that died  yea rather  that is risen again  who is even at the right hand of god  who also maketh intercession for us  
35	who shall separate us from the love of christ   shall  tribulation  or distress  or persecution  or famine  or nakedness  or peril  or sword  
36	as it is written  for thy sake we are killed all the day long  we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter  
37	nay  in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us  
38	for i am persuaded  that neither death  nor life  nor angels  nor principalities  nor powers  nor things present  nor things to come  
39	nor height  nor depth  nor any other creature  shall be able to separate us from the love of god  which is in christ jesus our lord

3	for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren  my kinsmen according to the flesh  
4	who are israelites  to whom  pertaineth  the adoption  and the glory  and the covenants  and the giving of the law  and the service  of god   and the promises  
5	whose  are  the fathers  and of whom as concerning the flesh christ  came   who is over all  god blessed for ever  amen  
6 	not as though the word of god hath taken none effect  for they  are  not all israel  which are of israel  
7	neither  because they are the seed of abraham   are they  all children  but  in isaac shall thy seed be called  
8	that is  they which are the children of the flesh  these  are  not the children of god  but the children of the promise are counted for the seed  
9	for this  is  the word of promise  at this time will i come  and sara shall have a son  
10	and not only  this   but when rebecca also had conceived by one   even  by our father isaac  
11	 for  the children  being not yet born  neither having done any good or evil  that the purpose of god according to election might stand  not of works  but of him that calleth   
12	it was said unto her  the elder shall serve the younger  
13	as it is written  jacob have i loved  but esau have i hated

15	for he saith to moses  i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy  and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion  
16	so then  it is  not of him that willeth  nor of him that runneth  but of god that sheweth mercy  
17	for the scripture saith unto pharaoh  even for this same purpose have i raised thee up  that i might shew my power in thee  and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth  
18	therefore hath he mercy on whom he will  have mercy   and whom he will he hardeneth  
19	thou wilt say then unto me  why doth he yet find fault  for who hath resisted his will  
20	nay but  o man  who art thou that repliest against god  shall the thing formed say to him that formed  it   why hast thou made me thus  
21	hath not the potter power over the clay  of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour  and another unto dishonour  
22	 what  if god  willing to shew  his  wrath  and to make his power known  endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction  
23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy  which he had afore prepared unto glory  
24	even us  whom he hath called  not of the jews only  but also of the gentiles  
25 	as he saith also in osee  i will call them my people  which were not my people  and her beloved  which was not beloved  
26	and it shall come to pass   that  in the place where it was said unto them  ye  are  not my people  there shall they be called the children of the living god  
27	esaias also crieth concerning israel  though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea  a remnant shall be saved  
28	for he will finish the work  and cut  it  short in righteousness  because a short work will the lord make upon the earth  
29	and as esaias said before  except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed  we had been as sodoma  and been made like unto gomorrha  
30 	what shall we say then  that the gentiles  which followed not after righteousness  have attained to righteousness  even the righteousness which is of faith  
31	but israel  which followed after the law of righteousness  hath not attained to the law of righteousness  
32	wherefore  because  they sought it  not by faith  but as it were by the works of the law  for they stumbled at that stumblingstone  
33	as it is written  behold  i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence  and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed  
romans 10
1 	brethren  my heart s desire and prayer to god for israel is  that they might be saved  
2	for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god  but not according to knowledge  
3	for they being ignorant of god s righteousness  and going about to establish their own righteousness  have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god  
4	for christ  is  the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth  
5	for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law  that the man which doeth those things shall live by them  
6	but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise  say not in thine heart  who shall ascend into heaven   that is  to bring christ down  from above    
7	or  who shall descend into the deep   that is  to bring up christ again from the dead   
8	but what saith it  the word is nigh thee   even  in thy mouth  and in thy heart  that is  the word of faith  which we preach  
9	that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved  
10	for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness  and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation  
11	for the scripture saith  whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed  
12 	for there is no difference between the jew and the greek  for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him  
13	for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved  
14	how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed  and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard  and how shall they hear without a preacher  
15	and how shall they preach  except they be sent  as it is written  how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace  and bring glad tidings of good things  
16	but they have not all obeyed the gospel  for esaias saith  lord  who hath believed our report  
17	so then faith  cometh  by hearing  and hearing by the word of god  
18	but i say  have they not heard  yes verily  their sound went into all the earth  and their words unto the ends of the world  
19	but i say  did not israel know  first moses saith  i will provoke you to jealousy by  them that are  no people   and  by a foolish nation i will anger you  
20	but esaias is very bold  and saith  i was found of them that sought me not  i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me

romans 11
1 	i say then  hath god cast away his people  god forbid  for i also am an israelite  of the seed of abraham   of  the tribe of benjamin  
2	god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew  wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias  how he maketh intercession to god against israel  saying  
3	lord  they have killed thy prophets  and digged down thine altars  and i am left alone  and they seek my life  
4	but what saith the answer of god unto him  i have reserved to myself seven thousand men  who have not bowed the knee to  the image of  baal  
5	even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace  
6	and if by grace  then  is it  no more of works  otherwise grace is no more grace  but if  it be  of works  then is it no more grace  otherwise work is no more work  
7	what then  israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for  but the election hath obtained it  and the rest were blinded 
8	 according as it is written  god hath given them the spirit of slumber  eyes that they should not see  and ears that they should not hear   unto this day  
9	and david saith  let their table be made a snare  and a trap  and a stumblingblock  and a recompence unto them  
10	let their eyes be darkened  that they may not see  and bow down their back alway  
11	i say then  have they stumbled that they should fall  god forbid  but  rather  through their fall salvation  is come  unto the gentiles  for to provoke them to jealousy  
12	now if the fall of them  be  the riches of the world  and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles  how much more their fulness  
13	for i speak to you gentiles  inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles  i magnify mine office  
14	if by any means i may provoke to emulation  them which are  my flesh  and might save some of them  
15	for if the casting away of them  be  the reconciling of the world  what  shall  the receiving  of them be   but life from the dead  
16	for if the firstfruit  be  holy  the lump  is  also  holy   and if the root  be  holy  so  are  the branches  
17	and if some of the branches be broken off  and thou  being a wild olive tree  wert graffed in among them  and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree  
18	boast not against the branches  but if thou boast  thou bearest not the root  but the root thee  
19	thou wilt say then  the branches were broken off  that i might be graffed in  
20	well  because of unbelief they were broken off  and thou standest by faith  be not highminded  but fear  
21	for if god spared not the natural branches   take heed  lest he also spare not thee  
22	behold therefore the goodness and severity of god  on them which fell  severity  but toward thee  goodness  if thou continue in  his  goodness  otherwise thou also shalt be cut off  
23	and they also  if they abide not still in unbelief  shall be graffed in  for god is able to graff them in again  
24	for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature  and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree  how much more shall these  which be the natural  branches   be graffed into their own olive tree  
25	for i would not  brethren  that ye should be ignorant of this mystery  lest ye should be wise in your own conceits  that blindness in part is happened to israel  until the fulness of the gentiles be come in  
26	and so all israel shall be saved  as it is written  there shall come out of sion the deliverer  and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob  
27	for this  is  my covenant unto them  when i shall take away their sins  
28	as concerning the gospel   they are  enemies for your sakes  but as touching the election   they are  beloved for the fathers  sakes  
29	for the gifts and calling of god  are  without repentance  
30	for as ye in times past have not believed god  yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief  
31	even so have these also now not believed  that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy  
32	for god hath concluded them all in unbelief  that he might have mercy upon all  
33 	o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god  how unsearchable  are  his judgments  and his ways past finding out  
34	for who hath known the mind of the lord  or who hath been his counsellor

6	he that regardeth the day  regardeth  it  unto the lord  and he that regardeth not the day  to the lord he doth not regard  it   he that eateth  eateth to the lord  for he giveth god thanks  and he that eateth not  to the lord he eateth not  and giveth god thanks  
7	for none of us liveth to himself  and no man dieth to himself  
8	for whether we live  we live unto the lord  and whether we die  we die unto the lord  whether we live therefore  or die  we are the lord s  
9	for to this end christ both died  and rose  and revived  that he might be lord both of the dead and living  
10	but why dost thou judge thy brother  or why dost thou set at nought thy brother  for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ  
11	for it is written   as  i live  saith the lord  every knee shall bow to me  and every tongue shall confess to god  
12	so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god  
13	let us not therefore judge one another any more  but judge this rather  that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in  his  brother s way  
14	i know  and am persuaded by the lord jesus  that  there is  nothing unclean of itself  but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean  to him  it is  unclean  
15	but if thy brother be grieved with  thy  meat  now walkest thou not charitably  destroy not him with thy meat  for whom christ died  
16	let not then your good be evil spoken of  
17	for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink  but righteousness  and peace  and joy in the holy ghost  
18	for he that in these things serveth christ  is  acceptable to god  and approved of men  
19	let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace  and things wherewith one may edify another  
20	for meat destroy not the work of god  all things indeed  are  pure  but  it is  evil for that man who eateth with offence  
21	 it is  good neither to eat flesh  nor to drink wine  nor  any thing  whereby thy brother stumbleth  or is offended  or is made weak  
22	hast thou faith  have  it  to thyself before god  happy  is  he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth  
23	and he that doubteth is damned if he eat  because  he eateth  not of faith  for whatsoever  is  not of faith is sin  
romans 15
1 	we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak  and not to please ourselves  
2	let every one of us please  his  neighbour for  his  good to edification  
3	for even christ pleased not himself  but  as it is written  the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me  
4	for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning  that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope  
5 	now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus  
6	that ye may with one mind  and  one mouth glorify god  even the father of our lord jesus christ  
7 	wherefore receive ye one another  as christ also received us to the glory of god  
8	now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god  to confirm the promises  made  unto the fathers  
9	and that the gentiles might glorify god for  his  mercy  as it is written  for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles  and sing unto thy name  
10	and again he saith  rejoice  ye gentiles  with his people  
11	and again  praise the lord  all ye gentiles  and laud him  all ye people  
12	and again  esaias saith  there shall be a root of jesse  and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles  in him shall the gentiles trust  
13 	now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing  that ye may abound in hope  through the power of the holy ghost  
14 	and i myself also am persuaded of you  my brethren  that ye also are full of goodness  filled with all knowledge  able also to admonish one another  
15	nevertheless  brethren  i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort  as putting you in mind  because of the grace that is given to me of god  
16	that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles  ministering the gospel of god  that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable  being sanctified by the holy ghost  
17 	i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god  
18	for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me  to make the gentiles obedient  by word and deed  
19	through mighty signs and wonders  by the power of the spirit of god  so that from jerusalem  and round about unto illyricum  i have fully preached the gospel of christ  
20	yea  so have i strived to preach the gospel  not where christ was named  lest i should build upon another man s foundation  
21	but as it is written  to whom he was not spoken of  they shall see  and they that have not heard shall understand  
22 	for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you  
23	but now having no more place in these parts  and having a great desire these many years to come unto you  
24	whensoever i take my journey into spain  i will come to you  for i trust to see you in my journey  and to be brought on my way thitherward by you  if first i be somewhat filled with your  company   
25	but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints  
26	for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem  
27	it hath pleased them verily  and their debtors they are  for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things  their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things  
28	when therefore i have performed this  and have sealed to them this fruit  i will come by you into spain  
29	and i am sure that  when i come unto you  i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ  
30 	now i beseech you  brethren  for the lord jesus christ s sake  and for the love of the spirit  that ye strive together with me in  your  prayers to god for me  
31	that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea  and that my service which  i have  for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints  
32	that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god  and may with you be refreshed

1 	paul  called  to be  an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god  and sosthenes  our  brother  
2	unto the church of god which is at corinth  to them that are sanctified in christ jesus  called  to be  saints  with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord  both theirs and ours  
3	grace  be  unto you  and peace  from god our father  and  from  the lord jesus christ  
4	i thank my god always on your behalf  for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ  
5	that in every thing ye are enriched by him  in all utterance  and  in  all knowledge  
6	even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you  
7	so that ye come behind in no gift  waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ  
8	who shall also confirm you unto the end   that ye may be  blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ  
9	god  is  faithful  by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord  
10 	now i beseech you  brethren  by the name of our lord jesus christ  that ye all speak the same thing  and  that  there be no divisions among you  but  that  ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment  
11	for it hath been declared unto me of you  my brethren  by them  which are of the house  of chloe  that there are contentions among you  
12	now this i say  that every one of you saith  i am of paul  and i of apollos  and i of cephas  and i of christ  
13	is christ divided  was paul crucified for you  or were ye baptized in the name of paul  
14 	i thank god that i baptized none of you  but crispus and gaius  
15	lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name  
16	and i baptized also the household of stephanas  besides  i know not whether i baptized any other  
17 	for christ sent me not to baptize  but to preach the gospel  not with wisdom of words  lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect  
18	for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness  but unto us which are saved it is the power of god  
19	for it is written  i will destroy the wisdom of the wise  and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent  
20	where  is  the wise  where  is  the scribe  where  is  the disputer of this world  hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world  
21	for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god  it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe  
22	for the jews require a sign  and the greeks seek after wisdom  
23	but we preach christ crucified  unto the jews a stumblingblock  and unto the greeks foolishness  
24	but unto them which are called  both jews and greeks  christ the power of god  and the wisdom of god  
25	because the foolishness of god is wiser than men  and the weakness of god is stronger than men  
26	for ye see your calling  brethren  how that not many wise men after the flesh  not many mighty  not many noble   are called   
27	but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise  and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty  
28	and base things of the world  and things which are despised  hath god chosen   yea   and things which are not  to bring to nought things that are  
29	that no flesh should glory in his presence  
30	but of him are ye in christ jesus  who of god is made unto us wisdom  and righteousness  and sanctification  and redemption  
31	that  according as it is written  he that glorieth  let him glory in the lord  
1 corinthians 2
1 	and i  brethren  when i came to you  came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom  declaring unto you the testimony of god  
2	for i determined not to know any thing among you  save jesus christ  and him crucified  
3	and i was with you in weakness  and in fear  and in much trembling  
4	and my speech and my preaching  was  not with enticing words of man s wisdom  but in demonstration of the spirit and of power  
5	that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men  but in the power of god  
6 	howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect  yet not the wisdom of this world  nor of the princes of this world  that come to nought  
7	but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery   even  the hidden  wisdom   which god ordained before the world unto our glory  
8	which none of the princes of this world knew  for had they known  it   they would not have crucified the lord of glory  
9	but as it is written  eye hath not seen  nor ear heard  neither have entered into the heart of man  the things which god hath prepared for them that love him  
10	but god hath revealed  them  unto us by his spirit  for the spirit searcheth all things  yea  the deep things of god  
11	for what man knoweth the things of a man  save the spirit of man which is in him  even so the things of god knoweth no man  but the spirit of god  
12	now we have received  not the spirit of the world  but the spirit which is of god  that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god  
13	which things also we speak  not in the words which man s wisdom teacheth  but which the holy ghost teacheth  comparing spiritual things with spiritual  
14	but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god  for they are foolishness unto him  neither can he know  them   because they are spiritually discerned  
15	but he that is spiritual judgeth all things  yet he himself is judged of no man  
16	for who hath known the mind of the lord  that he may instruct him  but we have the mind of christ  
1 corinthians 3
1 	and i  brethren  could not speak unto you as unto spiritual  but as unto carnal   even  as unto babes in christ  
2	i have fed you with milk  and not with meat  for hitherto ye were not able  to bear it   neither yet now are ye able  
3	for ye are yet carnal  for whereas  there is  among you envying  and strife  and divisions  are ye not carnal  and walk as men  
4	for while one saith  i am of paul  and another  i  am  of apollos  are ye not carnal  
5 	who then is paul  and who  is  apollos  but ministers by whom ye believed  even as the lord gave to every man  
6	i have planted  apollos watered  but god gave the increase  
7	so then neither is he that planteth any thing  neither he that watereth  but god that giveth the increase  
8	now he that planteth and he that watereth are one  and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour  
9	for we are labourers together with god  ye are god s husbandry   ye are  god s building  
10	according to the grace of god which is given unto me  as a wise masterbuilder  i have laid the foundation  and another buildeth thereon  but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon  
11 	for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid  which is jesus christ  
12	now if any man build upon this foundation gold  silver  precious stones  wood  hay  stubble  
13	every man s work shall be made manifest  for the day shall declare it  because it shall be revealed by fire  and the fire shall try every man s work of what sort it is  
14	if any man s work abide which he hath built thereupon  he shall receive a reward  
15	if any man s work shall be burned  he shall suffer loss  but he himself shall be saved  yet so as by fire  
16 	know ye not that ye are the temple of god  and  that  the spirit of god dwelleth in you  
17	if any man defile the temple of god  him shall god destroy  for the temple of god is holy  which  temple  ye are  
18 	let no man deceive himself  if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world  let him become a fool  that he may be wise  
19	for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god  for it is written  he taketh the wise in their own craftiness  
20	and again  the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise  that they are vain  
21 	therefore let no man glory in men  for all things are yours  
22	whether paul  or apollos  or cephas  or the world  or life  or death  or things present  or things to come  all are yours  
23	and ye are christ s  and christ  is  god s  
1 corinthians 4
1 	let a man so account of us  as of the ministers of christ  and stewards of the mysteries of god  
2	moreover it is required in stewards  that a man be found faithful  
3	but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you  or of man s judgment  yea  i judge not mine own self  
4	for i know nothing by myself  yet am i not hereby justified  but he that judgeth me is the lord  
5	therefore judge nothing before the time  until the lord come  who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness  and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts  and then shall every man have praise of god  
6	and these things  brethren  i have in a figure transferred to myself and  to  apollos for your sakes  that ye might learn in us not to think  of men  above that which is written  that no one of you be puffed up for one against another  
7 	for who maketh thee to differ  from another   and what hast thou that thou didst not receive  now if thou didst receive  it   why dost thou glory  as if thou hadst not received  it   
8	now ye are full  now ye are rich  ye have reigned as kings without us  and i would to god ye did reign  that we also might reign with you  
9	for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last  as it were appointed to death  for we are made a spectacle unto the world  and to angels  and to men  
10	we  are  fools for christ s sake  but ye  are  wise in christ  we  are  weak  but ye  are  strong  ye  are  honourable  but we  are  despised  
11	even unto this present hour we both hunger  and thirst  and are naked  and are buffeted  and have no certain dwellingplace  
12	and labour  working with our own hands  being reviled  we bless  being persecuted  we suffer it  
13	being defamed  we intreat  we are made as the filth of the world   and are  the offscouring of all things unto this day  
14 	i write not these things to shame you  but as my beloved sons i warn  you   
15	for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ  yet  have ye  not many fathers  for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel  
16	wherefore i beseech you  be ye followers of me  
17 	for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus  who is my beloved son  and faithful in the lord  who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ  as i teach every where in every church  
18	now some are puffed up  as though i would not come to you  
19	but i will come to you shortly  if the lord will  and will know  not the speech of them which are puffed up  but the power  
20	for the kingdom of god  is  not in word  but in power  
21	what will ye  shall i come unto you with a rod  or in love  and  in  the spirit of meekness  
1 corinthians 5
1 	it is reported commonly  that there is  fornication among you  and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles  that one should have his father s wife  
2	and ye are puffed up  and have not rather mourned  that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you  
3	for i verily  as absent in body  but present in spirit  have judged already  as though i were present   concerning  him that hath so done this deed  
4	in the name of our lord jesus christ  when ye are gathered together  and my spirit  with the power of our lord jesus christ  
5	to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh  that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus  
6	your glorying  is  not good  know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump  
7 	purge out therefore the old leaven  that ye may be a new lump  as ye are unleavened  for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us  
8	therefore let us keep the feast  not with old leaven  neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness  but with the unleavened  bread  of sincerity and truth  
9 	i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators  
10	yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world  or with the covetous  or extortioners  or with idolaters  for then must ye needs go out of the world  
11	but now i have written unto you not to keep company  if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator  or covetous  or an idolater  or a railer  or a drunkard  or an extortioner  with such an one no not to eat  
12	for what have i to do to judge them also that are without  do not ye judge them that are within  
13	but them that are without god judgeth  therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person  
1 corinthians 6
1 	dare any of you  having a matter against another  go to law before the unjust  and not before the saints  
2	do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world  and if the world shall be judged by you  are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters  
3	know ye not that we shall judge angels  how much more things that pertain to this life  
4	if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life  set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church  
5	i speak to your shame  is it so  that there is not a wise man among you  no  not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren  
6	but brother goeth to law with brother  and that before the unbelievers  
7	now therefore there is utterly a fault among you  because ye go to law one with another  why do ye not rather take wrong  why do ye not rather  suffer yourselves to  be defrauded  
8	nay  ye do wrong  and defraud  and that  your  brethren  
9 	know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceived  neither fornicators  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor effeminate  nor abusers of themselves with mankind  
10	nor thieves  nor covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners  shall inherit the kingdom of god  
11	and such were some of you  but ye are washed  but ye are sanctified  but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus  and by the spirit of our god  
12 	all things are lawful unto me  but all things are not expedient  all things are lawful for me  but i will not be brought under the power of any  
13	meats for the belly  and the belly for meats  but god shall destroy both it and them  now the body  is  not for fornication  but for the lord  and the lord for the body  
14	and god hath both raised up the lord  and will also raise up us by his own power  
15	know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ  shall i then take the members of christ  and make  them  the members of an harlot  god forbid  
16	what  know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body  for two  saith he  shall be one flesh  
17	but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit  
18	flee fornication  every sin that a man doeth is without the body  but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body  
19	what  know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost  which is  in you  which ye have of god  and ye are not your own  
20	for ye are bought with a price  therefore glorify god in your body  and in your spirit  which are god s  
1 corinthians 7
1 	now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me   it is  good for a man not to touch a woman  
2	nevertheless   to avoid  fornication  let every man have his own wife  and let every woman have her own husband  
3	let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence  and likewise also the wife unto the husband  
4	the wife hath not power of her own body  but the husband  and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body  but the wife  
5	defraud ye not one the other  except  it be  with consent for a time  that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer  and come together again  that satan tempt you not for your incontinency  
6	but i speak this by permission   and  not of commandment  
7	for i would that all men were even as i myself  but every man hath his proper gift of god  one after this manner  and another after that  
8	i say therefore to the unmarried and widows  it is good for them if they abide even as i  
9	but if they cannot contain  let them marry  for it is better to marry than to burn  
10 	and unto the married i command   yet  not i  but the lord  let not the wife depart from  her  husband  
11	but and if she depart  let her remain unmarried  or be reconciled to  her  husband  and let not the husband put away  his  wife  
12	but to the rest speak i  not the lord  if any brother hath a wife that believeth not  and she be pleased to dwell with him  let him not put her away  
13	and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not  and if he be pleased to dwell with her  let her not leave him  
14	for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife  and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband  else were your children unclean  but now are they holy  
15	but if the unbelieving depart  let him depart  a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such  cases   but god hath called us to peace  
16	for what knowest thou  o wife  whether thou shalt save  thy  husband  or how knowest thou  o man  whether thou shalt save  thy  wife  
17 	but as god hath distributed to every man  as the lord hath called every one  so let him walk  and so ordain i in all churches  
18	is any man called being circumcised  let him not become uncircumcised  is any called in uncircumcision  let him not be circumcised  
19	circumcision is nothing  and uncircumcision is nothing  but the keeping of the commandments of god  
20	let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called  
21	art thou called  being  a servant  care not for it  but if thou mayest be made free  use  it  rather  
22	for he that is called in the lord   being  a servant  is the lord s freeman  likewise also he that is called   being  free  is christ s servant  
23	ye are bought with a price  be not ye the servants of men  
24	brethren  let every man  wherein he is called  therein abide with god  
25 	now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord  yet i give my judgment  as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful  
26	i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress   i say   that  it is  good for a man so to be  
27	art thou bound unto a wife  seek not to be loosed  art thou loosed from a wife  seek not a wife  
28	but and if thou marry  thou hast not sinned  and if a virgin marry  she hath not sinned  nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh  but i spare you  
29	but this i say  brethren  the time  is  short  it remaineth  that both they that have wives be as though they had none  
30	and they that weep  as though they wept not  and they that rejoice  as though they rejoiced not  and they that buy  as though they possessed not  
31	and they that use this world  as not abusing  it   for the fashion of this world passeth away  
32	but i would have you without carefulness  he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord  how he may please the lord  
33	but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world  how he may please  his  wife  
34	there is difference  also  between a wife and a virgin  the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord  that she may be holy both in body and in spirit  but she that is married careth for the things of the world  how she may please  her  husband  
35	and this i speak for your own profit  not that i may cast a snare upon you  but for that which is comely  and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction  
36 	but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin  if she pass the flower of  her  age  and need so require  let him do what he will  he sinneth not  let them marry  
37	nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart  having no necessity  but hath power over his own will  and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin  doeth well  
38	so then he that giveth  her  in marriage doeth well  but he that giveth  her  not in marriage doeth better  
39 	the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth  but if her husband be dead  she is at liberty to be married to whom she will  only in the lord  
40	but she is happier if she so abide  after my judgment  and i think also that i have the spirit of god  
1 corinthians 8
1 	now as touching things offered unto idols  we know that we all have knowledge  knowledge puffeth up  but charity edifieth  
2	and if any man think that he knoweth any thing  he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know  
3	but if any man love god  the same is known of him  
4 	as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols  we know that an idol  is  nothing in the world  and that  there is  none other god but one  
5	for though there be that are called gods  whether in heaven or in earth   as there be gods many  and lords many   
6	but to us  there is but  one god  the father  of whom  are  all things  and we in him  and one lord jesus christ  by whom  are  all things  and we by him  
7 	howbeit  there is  not in every man that knowledge  for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat  it  as a thing offered unto an idol  and their conscience being weak is defiled  
8	but meat commendeth us not to god  for neither  if we eat  are we the better  neither  if we eat not  are we the worse  
9	but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak  
10	for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol s temple  shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols  
11	and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish  for whom christ died  
12	but when ye sin so against the brethren  and wound their weak conscience  ye sin against christ  
13	wherefore  if meat make my brother to offend  i will eat no flesh while the world standeth  lest i make my brother to offend  
1 corinthians 9
1 	am i not an apostle  am i not free  have i not seen jesus christ our lord  are not ye my work in the lord  
2	if i be not an apostle unto others  yet doubtless i am to you  for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord  
3 	mine answer to them that do examine me is this  
4	have we not power to eat and to drink  
5	have we not power to lead about a sister  a wife  as well as other apostles  and  as  the brethren of the lord  and cephas  
6	or i only and barnabas  have not we power to forbear working  
7	who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges  who planteth a vineyard  and eateth not of the fruit thereof  or who feedeth a flock  and eateth not of the milk of the flock  
8	say i these things as a man  or saith not the law the same also  
9	for it is written in the law of moses  thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn  doth god take care for oxen  
10	or saith he  it  altogether for our sakes  for our sakes  no doubt   this  is written  that he that ploweth should plow in hope  and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope  
11	if we have sown unto you spiritual things   is it  a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things  
12	if others be partakers of  this  power over you   are  not we rather  nevertheless we have not used this power  but suffer all things  lest we should hinder the gospel of christ  
13	do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live  of the things  of the temple  and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar  
14	even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel  
15 	but i have used none of these things  neither have i written these things  that it should be so done unto me  for  it were  better for me to die  than that any man should make my glorying void  
16	for though i preach the gospel  i have nothing to glory of  for necessity is laid upon me  yea  woe is unto me  if i preach not the gospel  
17	for if i do this thing willingly  i have a reward  but if against my will  a dispensation  of the gospel  is committed unto me  
18	what is my reward then   verily  that  when i preach the gospel  i may make the gospel of christ without charge  that i abuse not my power in the gospel  
19 	for though i be free from all  men   yet have i made myself servant unto all  that i might gain the more  
20	and unto the jews i became as a jew  that i might gain the jews  to them that are under the law  as under the law  that i might gain them that are under the law  
21	to them that are without law  as without law   being not without law to god  but under the law to christ   that i might gain them that are without law  
22	to the weak became i as weak  that i might gain the weak  i am made all things to all  men   that i might by all means save some  
23	and this i do for the gospel s sake  that i might be partaker thereof with  you   
24 	know ye not that they which run in a race run all  but one receiveth the prize  so run  that ye may obtain  
25	and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things  now they  do it  to obtain a corruptible crown  but we an incorruptible  
26	i therefore so run  not as uncertainly  so fight i  not as one that beateth the air  
27	but i keep under my body  and bring  it  into subjection  lest that by any means  when i have preached to others  i myself should be a castaway  
1 corinthians 10
1 	moreover  brethren  i would not that ye should be ignorant  how that all our fathers were under the cloud  and all passed through the sea  
2	and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea  
3	and did all eat the same spiritual meat  
4	and did all drink the same spiritual drink  for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them  and that rock was christ  
5	but with many of them god was not well pleased  for they were overthrown in the wilderness  
6 	now these things were our examples  to the intent we should not lust after evil things  as they also lusted  
7	neither be ye idolaters  as  were  some of them  as it is written  the people sat down to eat and drink  and rose up to play  
8	neither let us commit fornication  as some of them committed  and fell in one day three and twenty thousand  
9	neither let us tempt christ  as some of them also tempted  and were destroyed of serpents  
10	neither murmur ye  as some of them also murmured  and were destroyed of the destroyer  
11	now all these things happened unto them for ensamples  and they are written for our admonition  upon whom the ends of the world are come  
12	wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall  
13	there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man  but god  is  faithful  who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able  but will with the temptation also make a way to escape  that ye may be able to bear  it   
14	wherefore  my dearly beloved  flee from idolatry  
15 	i speak as to wise men  judge ye what i say  
16	the cup of blessing which we bless  is it not the communion of the blood of christ  the bread which we break  is it not the communion of the body of christ  
17	for we  being  many are one bread   and  one body  for we are all partakers of that one bread  
18	behold israel after the flesh  are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar  
19	what say i then  that the idol is any thing  or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing  
20	but i  say   that the things which the gentiles sacrifice  they sacrifice to devils  and not to god  and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils  
21	ye cannot drink the cup of the lord  and the cup of devils  ye cannot be partakers of the lord s table  and of the table of devils  
22	do we provoke the lord to jealousy  are we stronger than he  
23 	all things are lawful for me  but all things are not expedient  all things are lawful for me  but all things edify not  
24	let no man seek his own  but every man another s  wealth   
25	whatsoever is sold in the shambles   that  eat  asking no question for conscience sake  
26	for the earth  is  the lord s  and the fulness thereof  
27	if any of them that believe not bid you  to a feast   and ye be disposed to go  whatsoever is set before you  eat  asking no question for conscience sake  
28	but if any man say unto you  this is offered in sacrifice unto idols  eat not for his sake that shewed it  and for conscience sake  for the earth  is  the lord s  and the fulness thereof  
29	conscience  i say  not thine own  but of the other  for why is my liberty judged of another  man s  conscience  
30	for if i by grace be a partaker  why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks  
31	whether therefore ye eat  or drink  or whatsoever ye do  do all to the glory of god  
32	give none offence  neither to the jews  nor to the gentiles  nor to the church of god  
33	even as i please all  men  in all  things   not seeking mine own profit  but the  profit  of many  that they may be saved  
1 corinthians 11
1 	be ye followers of me  even as i also  am  of christ  
2	now i praise you  brethren  that ye remember me in all things  and keep the ordinances  as i delivered  them  to you  
3	but i would have you know  that the head of every man is christ  and the head of the woman  is  the man  and the head of christ  is  god  
4	every man praying or prophesying  having  his  head covered  dishonoureth his head  
5	but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with  her  head uncovered dishonoureth her head  for that is even all one as if she were shaven  
6	for if the woman be not covered  let her also be shorn  but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven  let her be covered  
7	for a man indeed ought not to cover  his  head  forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god  but the woman is the glory of the man  
8	for the man is not of the woman  but the woman of the man  
9	neither was the man created for the woman  but the woman for the man  
10	for this cause ought the woman to have power on  her  head because of the angels  
11	nevertheless neither is the man without the woman  neither the woman without the man  in the lord  
12	for as the woman  is  of the man  even so  is  the man also by the woman  but all things of god  
13	judge in yourselves  is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered  
14	doth not even nature itself teach you  that  if a man have long hair  it is a shame unto him  
15	but if a woman have long hair  it is a glory to her  for  her  hair is given her for a covering  
16	but if any man seem to be contentious  we have no such custom  neither the churches of god  
17 	now in this that i declare  unto you  i praise  you  not  that ye come together not for the better  but for the worse  
18	for first of all  when ye come together in the church  i hear that there be divisions among you  and i partly believe it  
19	for there must be also heresies among you  that they which are approved may be made manifest among you  
20	when ye come together therefore into one place   this  is not to eat the lord s supper  
21	for in eating every one taketh before  other  his own supper  and one is hungry  and another is drunken  
22	what  have ye not houses to eat and to drink in  or despise ye the church of god  and shame them that have not  what shall i say to you  shall i praise you in this  i praise  you  not  
23 	for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you  that the lord jesus the  same  night in which he was betrayed took bread  
24	and when he had given thanks  he brake  it   and said  take  eat  this is my body  which is broken for you  this do in remembrance of me  
25	after the same manner also  he took  the cup  when he had supped  saying  this cup is the new testament in my blood  this do ye  as oft as ye drink  it   in remembrance of me  
26	for as often as ye eat this bread  and drink this cup  ye do shew the lord s death till he come  
27	wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread  and drink  this  cup of the lord  unworthily  shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord  
28	but let a man examine himself  and so let him eat of  that  bread  and drink of  that  cup  
29	for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily  eateth and drinketh damnation to himself  not discerning the lord s body  
30	for this cause many  are  weak and sickly among you  and many sleep  
31	for if we would judge ourselves  we should not be judged  
32	but when we are judged  we are chastened of the lord  that we should not be condemned with the world  
33	wherefore  my brethren  when ye come together to eat  tarry one for another  
34	and if any man hunger  let him eat at home  that ye come not together unto condemnation  and the rest will i set in order when i come  
1 corinthians 12
1 	now concerning spiritual  gifts   brethren  i would not have you ignorant  
2	ye know that ye were gentiles  carried away unto these dumb idols  even as ye were led  
3	wherefore i give you to understand  that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed  and  that  no man can say that jesus is the lord  but by the holy ghost  
4	now there are diversities of gifts  but the same spirit  
5	and there are differences of administrations  but the same lord  
6	and there are diversities of operations  but it is the same god which worketh all in all  
7	but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal  
8	for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom  to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit  
9	to another faith by the same spirit  to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit  
10	to another the working of miracles  to another prophecy  to another discerning of spirits  to another  divers  kinds of tongues  to another the interpretation of tongues  
11	but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit  dividing to every man severally as he will  
12 	for as the body is one  and hath many members  and all the members of that one body  being many  are one body  so also  is  christ  
13	for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body  whether  we be  jews or gentiles  whether  we be  bond or free  and have been all made to drink into one spirit  
14	for the body is not one member  but many  
15	if the foot shall say  because i am not the hand  i am not of the body  is it therefore not of the body  
16	and if the ear shall say  because i am not the eye  i am not of the body  is it therefore not of the body  
17	if the whole body  were  an eye  where  were  the hearing  if the whole  were  hearing  where  were  the smelling  
18	but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body  as it hath pleased him  
19	and if they were all one member  where  were  the body  
20	but now  are they  many members  yet but one body  
21	and the eye cannot say unto the hand  i have no need of thee  nor again the head to the feet  i have no need of you  
22	nay  much more those members of the body  which seem to be more feeble  are necessary  
23	and those  members  of the body  which we think to be less honourable  upon these we bestow more abundant honour  and our uncomely  parts  have more abundant comeliness  
24	for our comely  parts  have no need  but god hath tempered the body together  having given more abundant honour to that  part  which lacked  
25	that there should be no schism in the body  but  that  the members should have the same care one for another  
26	and whether one member suffer  all the members suffer with it  or one member be honoured  all the members rejoice with it  
27 	now ye are the body of christ  and members in particular  
28	and god hath set some in the church  first apostles  secondarily prophets  thirdly teachers  after that miracles  then gifts of healings  helps  governments  diversities of tongues  
29	 are  all apostles   are  all prophets   are  all teachers   are  all workers of miracles  
30	have all the gifts of healing  do all speak with tongues  do all interpret  
31	but covet earnestly the best gifts  and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way  
1 corinthians 13
1 	though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels  and have not charity  i am become  as  sounding brass  or a tinkling cymbal  
2	and though i have  the gift of  prophecy  and understand all mysteries  and all knowledge  and though i have all faith  so that i could remove mountains  and have not charity  i am nothing  
3	and though i bestow all my goods to feed  the poor   and though i give my body to be burned  and have not charity  it profiteth me nothing  
4 	charity suffereth long   and  is kind  charity envieth not  charity vaunteth not itself  is not puffed up  
5	doth not behave itself unseemly  seeketh not her own  is not easily provoked  thinketh no evil  
6	rejoiceth not in iniquity  but rejoiceth in the truth  
7	beareth all things  believeth all things  hopeth all things  endureth all things  
8 	charity never faileth  but whether  there be  prophecies  they shall fail  whether  there be  tongues  they shall cease  whether  there be  knowledge  it shall vanish away  
9	for we know in part  and we prophesy in part  
10	but when that which is perfect is come  then that which is in part shall be done away  
11	when i was a child  i spake as a child  i understood as a child  i thought as a child  but when i became a man  i put away childish things  
12	for now we see through a glass  darkly  but then face to face  now i know in part  but then shall i know even as also i am known  
13	and now abideth faith  hope  charity  these three  but the greatest of these  is  charity  
1 corinthians 14
1 	follow after charity  and desire spiritual  gifts   but rather that ye may prophesy  
2	for he that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue speaketh not unto men  but unto god  for no man understandeth  him   howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries  
3	but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men  to  edification  and exhortation  and comfort  
4	he that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue edifieth himself  but he that prophesieth edifieth the church  
5	i would that ye all spake with tongues  but rather that ye prophesied  for greater  is  he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues  except he interpret  that the church may receive edifying  
6 	now  brethren  if i come unto you speaking with tongues  what shall i profit you  except i shall speak to you either by revelation  or by knowledge  or by prophesying  or by doctrine  
7	and even things without life giving sound  whether pipe or harp  except they give a distinction in the sounds  how shall it be known what is piped or harped  
8	for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound  who shall prepare himself to the battle  
9	so likewise ye  except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood  how shall it be known what is spoken  for ye shall speak into the air  
10	there are  it may be  so many kinds of voices in the world  and none of them  is  without signification  
11	therefore
